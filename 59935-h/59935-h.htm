<h1 class='nobreak' id='t106'>I</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, sir, I’ve come to see to you,”
announced the Very Small Person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Archibald turned from his easel, eyed
the intruder with amazement, faintly tinged
with alarm, and thought of laughing—but did
not laugh. She was such a mere wisp of a
child and so profoundly serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you have, have you?” the painter remarked
feebly. There was a solemn determination
about this invader of his privacy that
made him uncomfortably sure she would do
whatever she had come to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, I’m Pegeen O’Neill. I’ll begin
in the kitchen. They say it’s a sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was taking off her battered straw hat
and her wet coat and rubbers, and rolling up
the sleeves of her clean but much patched
gingham dress. The artist liked her better
without the hat, though the extraordinary
mass of black tumbled curls was too heavy a
frame for the thin, sensitive, little face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought cleaning rags with me.” The
child had an oddly efficient air. One understood
that she would always bring the needed
things with her. “Men never have such
things around. They’re the wastingest creatures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I do have rags around—often,”
protested Archibald, “only I’m usually wearing
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weak attempt to meet the situation
lightly made no impression upon her seriousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind. I’ll keep you mended up
now,” she said, with an air of brisk capability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“B-b-but,” began the painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go right on with your painting,” she
advised kindly but firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t want to come in here to-day, if that
kitchen’s anything like what they say it is, ’n’
maybe it’ll clear up by to-morrow so that you
can paint outdoors and not be in my way.
What time do you have dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked helplessly at the clock. Meals
were always a movable feast with him. He
had them when he chanced to think of them,
when the light was poor, when the work went
badly, when there happened to be something
in the house to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right,” said the Very Small Person,
quite as though he had explained all this aloud.
“But I guess we’ll have our dinner at half-past
twelve. You just go right ahead until
then and don’t mind me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went into the kitchen and shut the
door gently behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was how it began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Archibald had run away from New
York—and from Nadine Ransome. The two
had sapped his strength and dulled his spirit
and blurred his vision. He loved them both—and,
in much the same way, loved the
beauty and the power and the indescribable,
gripping charm of them; but the soul of him
had run away from them before they had altogether
had their way with it and had carried
his fagged brain and struggling heart to a
place where June was busy with a wonderful
outdoor world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little shack on the edge of a
wood, with a meadow dropping away from
before the doorstep to join a quiet green valley
that wandered narrowly between two lines of
blue hills into dim, purple distances. He had
camped there once, with a fellow artist, and,
on a day when the city world was an ache in
his brain and a bitterness in his heart, the
winding, white ribbon of valley road and the
upland meadow trail had called to him, the
murmur of pine top seas and the drip of fern-hidden
springs and the silences of green woodland
dusks, had promised peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he ran away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running away may not be heroic, but at
times it is exceedingly wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shack and the land upon which it stood
belonged to a colony of Shakers who lived
across the Valley among the heaven-climbing
hills, and they rented it willingly but with
mild amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thee doesn’t intend to live in it?” asked
the gray-clad eldress with the visioning eyes
and the firm chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When it rains,” explained the tenant.
“The rest of the time I’ll live out of doors.
I’m a painter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yea,—an artist!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her tones conveyed an understanding that
unto artists all forms of lunacy were possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the man who had run away took
possession of four rooms, a big stone fireplace,
a rusty stove, a table, three rough chairs and
a decrepit pine bureau. He made an expedition
to a neighboring town, bought a comfortable
willow chair, some cushions and linen, a
few dishes and cooking utensils, a broom, and
a couch hammock. With the broom he made
a clumsy, half-hearted, masculine attack upon
the accumulated dirt of years. He hung the
hammock in the living-room where it served
in lieu of bed, knocked up some shelves for
books, set an easel by the north window, built
a fire on the hearth, pulled the willow chair
up in front of it, lighted his pipe, and was at
home—but not at peace. The place was
haunted by ghosts he had brought with him.
Beneath the night noises of wood and meadow
he heard the muffled throb and roar of city
streets. In every corner lurked a shadowy
face—an alluring, heartbreaking face, with
lying promises in its eyes and lying smiles on
its lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the open, with the sun and wind and trees
and sky for comrades, he could forget; but,
when the violet dusk closed in and the friendly,
green-gold world fell a-dreaming and lost
itself in faint silver lights and creeping
shadows, the old longing stirred, the old fight
began again. It always ended by his flinging
out into the night and tramping the roads and
paths under the still stars or through the
storm. It is hard to be strong within four
walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He painted in a desultory way and he made
friends with shy, wood creatures who finally
accepted him as a harmless and well-meaning
neighbor, and he fished a little and read a
little and cooked a little and roamed the
woods and fields a great deal, and June was
kind to him in her bountiful, burgeoning
way; but she worked no sudden cure. Nature
does not hurry, even in her healing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, on the stormy morning when the Very
Small Person appeared at the shack, John
Archibald, standing before a window and
watching the rain sweep down the Valley like
a gray veil, through which the glooming hills
peered, shadow-like and shivering, had admitted
to himself that he was nearer in tune
than he had been in many a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silver flails of the rain, beating against
the swaying young birches, made his fingers
itch for a paint brush, the low-hung cloud
masses tangled in the wind-tossed locks of the
pines brought a smile to his lips, a clump of
mountain laurel blurred to misty rose by the
rain curtain set his memory groping for some
half-forgotten melody. Yes: there was
beauty in the world and he still had eyes for
it, and there were worse things than a leaping
fire on a hearth and a summer rain against the
window panes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down before his easel and went to
work with a whistled tune on his lips. After
the Very Small Person had appeared and disappeared,
he took up the work and the tune
where he had left off; but when it occurred to
him that he was whistling, he stopped
abruptly. No man likes to admit to himself
that he is convalescent from a heart malady he
has believed fatal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A particularly happy experiment with
madder made him forget that he was a passion-racked
soul and set him whistling gaily
once more. The Very Small Person interrupted
a carefully executed bit from <span class='it'>Rigoletto</span>
when she came in from the kitchen, carrying
a tray load much too big for her and
went about setting the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald looked up from his sketch, stared
at her blankly, remembered, and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” he said, whirling around on his
chair and resting his arms on its back, “you
are seeing to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yessir. Dinner’ll be ready in a minute.
I couldn’t find a tablecloth, so I took a paper
napkin. S’pose you use them to get out of
washing, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” acknowledged the painter. “What—if
it isn’t intrusive to ask—are we going to
have for dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, bread ’n’ milk was all you had in the
house; but I’d sort of figured it would be that
way, so I stopped at Mrs. Neal’s on my way
up. I knew you got your butter ’n’ eggs, ’n’
milk there, ’n’ I told her you needed eggs ’n’
butter, ’n’ then, while I was there, I got a slice
of ham—their hams are fine—’n’ some fresh
pot cheese ’n’ a jar of preserves. Mrs. Neal
says she’ll be glad to let us have anything she
can spare. I told her to save us a chicken for
Sunday. She was real interested about my
doing your work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> interesting,” agreed Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yessir. She said the folks along the Valley
were just downright troubled about your
living so dirty ’n’ accidental when anybody
could see you were used to having things
proper. They’d all come up and looked in
through the windows when you were away, so
they knew how things were. Course they understood
about you being an artist ’n’ that that
was why, but Mrs. Neal said she’d feel a heap
more comfortable, knowing I was seeing to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I’ll feel more comfortable, myself,
after I get over the first shock,” confessed
the artist, eyeing with approval the ham and
eggs which had just been put upon the table;
“but may I ask how you came to undertake
seeing to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know. I heard folks talking
about how shiftless and helpless you were, ’n’
that kind of bothered me; ’n’ then she said yesterday:
‘Pegeen, why don’t you go and take
care of that ridikilus orphan up in the shack?’
’N’ I said, ‘Why, I don’t know.’ ’N’ she said,
‘You need somebody to take care of, ’n’ he
certainly needs somebody to take care of him,
’n’ it looks to me like a good combination.’
’N’ I said, ‘Well, I guess I will.’ So I came,
to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said she was sure we’d get along finely
together. She’s seen you somewhere; ’n’ she
said you looked unhappy and neglected but
sort of nice, ’n’ as if you’d be a credit to me,
after a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Optimistic soul,” laughed Archibald.
“Who is She?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Very Small Person started for the
kitchen after another cup of coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, she’s the Smiling Lady,” she called
back across her shoulder, as she went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were left hanging on the air,
and the little room seemed the brighter for
them. Archibald said them over to himself
softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Smiling Lady!” Had another Mona
Lisa come to light in this Peaceful Valley?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegeen,” he asked as the small girl came
with his coffee, “who <span class='it'>is</span> the Smiling Lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She set the full cup down carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s just a name for her,” she explained.
“I made it for her when she first
came, ’n’ it fitted her so well that the others
took it up, ’n’ now she’s the Smiling Lady all
up ’n’ down the Valley; but her other name’s
Moran.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does she smile prettily, Peggy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It just melts the heart out of you, sir, it
does—but she isn’t always smiling, you know—not
with her lips. It’s a sort of a smile that
goes with her like the words to a tune. ’N’
her hair’s all bright ’n’ ripply ’n’ smiley, ’n’
she walks so light, ’n’ she just has a way with
her. When she comes into a room you feel
as if birds had begun singing there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald leaned back in his chair and
looked at the slip of a girl, with the thin, expressive
face in which now adoration glowed
warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegeen,” he said, with conviction, “when
you aren’t taking care of somebody, you write
poetry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir. I haven’t ever. I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s the making of a poet in you.
Did you say the Smiling Lady’s name was
Mrs. Moran?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice held a tint of anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Moran, it is. She isn’t married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better, much better. Peggy, my
child, I <span class='it'>like</span> the way you take care of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that night the ghosts forgot to walk.</p>

<h1 id='t455'>II</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald wakened, sniffed incredulously,
sat up in his hammock bed, and
sniffed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, it certainly was coffee—good coffee,
and there was a subdued rustle and stir beyond
the door leading into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why, of course! He was being “seen to.”
Pegeen had come back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not really expected her, but he
might have known she was not one to put her
hand to the plow and look back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incidentally it might be well for him to
arise and shine. The Young Person who had
adopted him had intimated that, if the weather
cleared over night, he would be expected to
paint out of doors and let her clean his quarters.
When she got ready to clean she would
probably clean, and he must breakfast and
make his escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Queer how mad women, even very small
women, were about cleaning things. No man
could stand against them when the sacred rage
possessed them. He would not think of attempting
it. No more comfortable and unashamed
grubbiness. He was going to be
kept clean, whether he would or no. He
had seen it in the gleam of Peggy’s eye.
When she saw to people, she saw to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a whimsical smile on the face
the man turned toward the kitchen, but his
eyes were very kind. On the whole, he was
rather glad he had been taken in hand. He
liked the Very Small Person and there was
something pleasant about awakening to an
aroma of coffee and a smell of toast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a hasty toilet and looked into the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ready?” said Pegeen, briskly. “I
forgot to ask you last night when you wanted
breakfast, so I just decided to have it at eight.
I’d have called you, only I heard you moving
around. How d’ you like your boiled eggs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a theory that I like them cooked
two minutes,” said Archibald, humbly, “but
I’ve never been able to get them that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ll get them now. She likes hers
coddled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, does she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yessir. I’d love to coddle you some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve an idea you’ll coddle me a great
deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just the way she twists things. I
didn’t know anybody else did. It makes talking
lots more fun, don’t it? Most people talk
right straight ahead about sensible things and
you’d as leave they’d stop any time. I like
it when sometimes you say what you don’t
mean or don’t say what you mean—not lies,
you know, but all twisty, like a guessing game—’n’
then I like the things that don’t mean
things—just sound as if they did,—snarks and
goober snatches and such, you know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She read me lots of those when I had
measles. Measles was the best time I’ve ever
had. I went and had them right at her house
when I was staying there over Sunday once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flew into the other room, set the table,
and came back for the coffee and toast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you sit down ’n’ I’ll cook that two-minute
egg. We’ll have to fix a bed for you
in the little room where you’ve got your
trunk, so I can come in here and have the table
all ready soon as I get here mornings. It’s
kind of messy anyway, sleeping in your dining-room.
It’d be nice if you could afford another
hammock for your bedroom. This one
helps to furnish here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send for another,” said the man who
was being seen to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got his two-minute egg, and the coffee
was delicious, and the toast was crisp and
browned and hot as the toast one sees in hungry
dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he ate, Pegeen went out and came
back with her hands full of maidenhair fern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might send for some vases when
you’re ordering the hammock,” she said
happily, as she put the ferns in a glass of water
and set them on the table. “She says it’s
wicked to let a room starve for flowers and
green things when you can’t walk a step outdoors
without finding something that would
put heart into the very lonesomest, saddest
room. I always did like flowers, but I never
realized about ferns and green things till she
showed me, ’n’ now I like them most better ’n
flowers. They’re so cool, ’n’ fresh, ’n’ kind
of resting. There’s always flowers or ferns
or pine branches or bayberry or something in
her rooms. I guess that’s why, even when
she isn’t in them, they all seem kind of as if
she must have just gone through them, smiling
in her eyes, the way she does. Is that egg all
right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfect. She must be rather a wonderful
Smiling Lady. Where does she live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right down the other side of Pine Knob.
You can go over or around, but it’s prettiest
over. There’s a spring up on top with pine
trees around it and a place where you can look
way out ’n’ out ’n’ out. She goes up there
sometimes to watch the sunset. My, but she
does love things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And people?” questioned Archibald, idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I should say! She’s the lovingest
thing. Sometimes I think the Loving Lady’d
be a better name than the Smiling Lady, but
I guess it’s all the same thing. Loving makes
smiling, don’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” said the man. His voice
rang hard, and Pegeen shot a swift, surprised
look at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it ought to,” she said soberly.
“That’s what it’s really for—except when
people you love get sick or die—or are bad.
’N’ if they’re bad that’s because they aren’t
loving. She says if you love hard enough you
just naturally make the world smiley—only
you have to be sure it’s the real, right love,
the kind of love God has. She’s the funniest
thing. She talks about God right out, as if
He were folks, ’n’ as if He and she had beautiful
times together—like my measles. ’N’
she don’t go to church so awfully much either,
’n’ once I saw her sew on Sunday. That was
when they were trying to get some clothes
ready for the Johnston twins that came unexpected.
I asked her how she was going to
fix <span class='it'>that</span> with God—my mother was a Presbyterian—’n’
she laughed ’n’ said she didn’t
have to fix it, ’cause sewing in His name was
just as good as praying in His name, ’n’ loving
was a bigger commandment ’n that one about
not doing any work, ’n’ those twins surely
would need loving, with their mother having
no back bone ’n’ their father having delirious
tremors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nice out of doors now, ’n’ as soon as
I wash dishes I’m going to begin cleaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m off,” laughed Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be over before dinner ’n’ I’ll only do
it thorough once a week,” she called after him
encouragingly, as he went away down the sunlit
slope where the daisies made way for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal, his nearest neighbor, who was
working in her garden as he skirted her side
yard, dropped her trowel and strolled over to
the fence when she saw him coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a sociable woman. He had discovered
that before and resented it. Above
all things in the world he had wanted to escape
from people, to be left alone with his
bruised soul; but, oddly enough, he was not
conscious of bruises this morning, was not even
conscious of a soul, which is quite as things
should be on a June morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, to the waiting woman’s surprise,
he took his pipe from his mouth, bade her a
blithe good morning, rested his elbows comfortably
on the top rail of the fence beside her
own, and smiled into her broad, astonished,
and kindly face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My land,” said the woman. “Was it as
bad as all that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was,” admitted the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here I was thinking it was a bad disposition.
Just goes to show that you never
can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal’s tone was self-reproachful.
Her face had taken on creases still more
kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told Peggy she’d got her work cut out
for her; but she said if you was grouchy you
needed seein’ to all the more, and that bein’
grouchy was, like as not, just not bein’ used to
bein’ pleasant; but I didn’t suppose she’d
get you used to bein’ pleasant as quick as
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald’s grin held no hurt vanity. He
had evidently made an uncommonly bad first
impression, but his neighbor was plainly ready
and willing to reverse her judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here all the time you was only lonesome,”
Mrs. Neal went on, in her fat, friendly
voice. “Well, Pegeen surely is quite a kid.
Now, ain’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is,” agreed the man emphatically.
“Tell me about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman draped her bulk more comfortably
over the fence, as one who settles herself
for a long social session. She always had time
to visit, and next to the sound of her own voice,
she loved best the sound of another person’s
voice, yet she managed to accomplish an astonishing
amount of work between talks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she began, her eyes looking past the
listening man and down the winding road,
“Peggy wasn’t born here. She came along
one day on a broken-down cart behind a
broken-down horse. A baby thing she was,
only five years old, but she was taking care of
folks already. I saw ’em as they went by here
and the youngster was pulling a shawl up
tight around her mother’s throat and shoulders.
Broken down worse’n the cart and
horse, the woman was. I never saw anybody
more peaked and sad. Why, say, that
woman’s eyes made you <span class='it'>ache</span>—except when
they looked at Peggy. I don’t know but what
they made you ache worse than ever then.
The little smile that came into them looked
so sort of pitiful in that face of hers. You
know the kind of face—the kind that’s been
pretty once and fine, but has had the youth
and prettiness and fineness all killed out of
it. A face that’s sort of a tombstone telling
where everything worth while in a life has
been buried. She’d been clear outside her
husband’s class. It was easy to tell that.
Land knows how she ever came to marry him.
Common, drunken brute he was. Might have
been handsome in a beefy sort of a way once,
but drink had knocked that out of him, along
with any other decency he might have had.
Honest to God, if I’d ’a’ been a man I’d ’a’
started every day by going down the road and
licking that man O’Neill, just for luck; but
his wife wouldn’t have thanked me for it—nor
Peg either. The woman didn’t love him,
but she had some queer idea of duty or pluck
or something hidden away in her, and she
never complained and never let any one say
hard things about him to her.—Just hid
what she could, and endured what she couldn’t
hide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I figured it that she’d run away and married
a handsome, blarneying, good-for-nothing
Irishman against her family’s wishes and
in the face of all sorts of prophecies about the
evil that’d come of it, and seeing as she’d
made her bed she was going to lie on it without
whining. I’ll bet her folks never knew
how things went with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She tried to teach Peggy what she could
and the youngster was a good deal like her
in some ways—tidy, little mite with pretty
ideas about things and lots of pluck. She
ain’t a whiner, no more ’n her mother, but it
ain’t all plain pluck with Peg. She’s got just
the one good thing that her father had to
give her, ’n’ that’s cheerfulness. She’s got a
disposition like one of them toy balloons, Peg
has, and it’s a good thing. If it hadn’t been
for that she’d ’a’ been dead, with all the responsibility
and want and abuse she’s had to
stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s too old for her years, of course, and
she’s got serious ways and some awfully
grown-up thoughts, but she’ll never die of
broken heart and broken spirit like her mother
did. No, sir. You can’t down Peg. That’s
the Irish in her. She’d see something cheerful
and encouraging in a smallpox epidemic—’n’
she’d be out nursing the sick ones too.
Well, there’s no telling what the man was
himself before the drink got him. He was
something a fine-souled, big-hearted woman
fell in love with, and maybe a better father
might have given Peggy something that
wasn’t as handy to have around as her cheerfulness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What became of the mother?” Archibald
asked. There was a very friendly light in his
eyes as he looked into the face beside him.
He was going to like this neighbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she dragged around, getting weaker
and weaker and thinner and thinner and
whiter and whiter. I’ll say one thing for
O’Neill. He never beat her—not even when
he was drunk. He didn’t make a living
for her and he didn’t raise a hand to help
her, the lazy whelp. Chopped her own
wood, she did, when Peggy didn’t pick it up
in the woods. The neighbors would have
helped but they couldn’t do much—didn’t
dare. She was so proud she’d rather starve
than take charity. You couldn’t even offer
it—just had to do what you could in a round-about,
happen-so way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By and by she took to her bed and then
Peggy had to do everything that got done.
She surely was a wonder too—waited on her
mother hand and foot, and kept things clean
and cooked whenever there was anything to
cook, and got wood to keep them all warm,
and looked after O’Neill as if he was a bad
child that she loved even if he was bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then her mother died about a year ago.
That did for O’Neill. He’d been a brute to
the woman, but then he’d been a brute to himself.
The drink did it, and some place back
in his rotten old soul I guess there was a clean
spot that loved her. He was too drunk to see
her buried and he kept that way most of the
time for two or three months. Lord knows
where he got the money for his whisky.
Peggy used to help around at the neighbors,
taking care of babies mostly. She’s a wonderful
hand with babies. Some of the folks
offered to take her on and look out for her, but
she wouldn’t leave her father, and what little
she made she’d use to feed him—washed for
him, too, and tried to keep his clothes mended.
Her mother had taught her to read and write
and spell, and she went to school sometimes
when she could. O’Neill’d be off for two
or three days at a time and then she’d slip
down to the schoolhouse. Miss Keyes, the
teacher, says Peg’s the smartest scholar she
ever had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t some one interfere legally and
take her away from her father?” asked Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t really know Peg yet,” she said.
“We all worried a great deal and did what we
could to help the child, but as for taking her
away from what she thought was her duty—from
somebody that was dependent on her—well,
you wait till you know Pegeen O’Neill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Neill, he settled the business himself by
going off on one of his sprees and not coming
back at all. The Lord knows what became of
him. I hope he’s dead and I guess he is, but
his mind had sort of been going for a while
before he left and Peggy, she has an idea that
he just lost his memory and didn’t know
where he belonged, or else he’d have come
home to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grieved for him—that youngster did.
Not exactly about her being without him, but
about his being without her. She was afraid
he was somewhere crazy and wasn’t being seen
to properly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several of us offered to take her in, after
that, but what’d she do but go over to Mrs.
Potter’s. She was sick—Mrs. Potter I mean—and
had a little baby, and her husband’s
work took him away most of the time. Poison
poor, they were too. Peg she said they sort
of needed her and she’d got the habit of taking
care of somebody; so she took on that job
until Mrs. Potter died. Then she took care
of the baby until its mother’s folks came and
got it last month. Peg felt real bad about the
baby, but Mrs. Benderby’s husband had died
in the winter and she was all alone and walking
down to the village, three miles, early
every morning to get day’s work and walking
home, dog tired, at night; so Peg she said
she’d just move over and see to Mrs. Benderby.—Gets
up and has fire and breakfast
at half-past six for the woman and tidies up the
house and mends and has a supper waiting for
the poor soul when she comes in at night.
That didn’t keep the child busy though; so
she took you on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens!” protested the man. “It’s
too much for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it ain’t,”—Mrs. Neal’s smile was reassuring.
“It’s just a lark for her at your
place and she’ll have good food up there and
make a little money, and she can fix Mrs. Benderby
up, night and morning, all the same.
Peg’s got to take care of something with all
her might and it may as well be you and Mrs.
Benderby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps it may,” agreed Mrs. Benderby’s
fellow beneficiary, humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that there was a little talk of June
peas and lettuce and the vicious propensities
of cut worms; and then Mrs. Neal went back
to her gardening, while Archibald swung
himself over a stone wall into the road, over
another wall into a clover field, and made his
leisurely way toward the most sketchable of
willow-fringed brooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while he made pretense of working,
but even the brook laughed at the faint-heartedness
of his efforts and the drooping
willow boughs quivered with mirth and the
sunlight stealing through the green leaves
danced over his canvas and mocked at its futility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Work? In June?” sang a bird in the willows
and, at the idea, all the summer world
laughed with the brook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smell!” whispered the clover sea, billowing
away from the tree shadows where he sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feel!” crooned the breeze, touching his
cheek with cool, caressing fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” shouted the sun, driving shadow-throwing
clouds across the low meadowland
and up the far blue hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen!” lilted the bird in the branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald gave up the struggle. Why
dabble with paints? Loafing was more glorious
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re quite right about it,” he said cheerfully
to the derisive brook. “I’m a punk
painter, but the Lord knew his business when
he sketched in June. Come along and show
me more of the canvas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set off across the meadow, the brook
chuckling its sunlit way beside him and together
they wandered down the Valley. A
companionable brook it was, full of surprises
and whimsies as a woman, running quietly
through brown, sun-warmed shallows, working
itself into a fury against solid, unyielding
stones, dreaming under overhanging elders,
glooming among thick clustering pine trees,
dashing noisily, recklessly, down steep slopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winding and wandering, it led its comrade
around the base of Pine Knob, into a bird-enchanted
woodland and whirling suddenly
around a sharp corner, swooped out into an
open, birch-fringed glade where a host of
Quaker ladies powdered the grass and butter-cups
made love to them brazenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” shouted the brook, leaping a
mossy stone for sheer love of splashing, and
making rainbows in the sunlight. “What do
you think of June now?” With a gurgle of
glee it romped away through the birches, but
Archibald stayed in the glade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl was sitting among the Quaker
ladies. Her hair was full of golden lights.
Her eyes were full of laughter. Her lap was
full of flowers and puppies and kittens. A
big collie dog stood sentinel at her shoulder.
At her feet on the grass, two fat babies rolled
about in a riotous tussle with a puppy, strayed
from the lapful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A twig cracked under the man’s foot. The
dog growled warningly and the girl, glancing
round, saw the intruder standing among the
birches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently she was not startled, and she
was as little embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t pay any attention to him. It’s
principle with him, not passion,” she said, laying
a quieting hand on the dog’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald and she might have been meeting
every day for months. Not a hint of self-consciousness
ruffled her gay serenity. She
made no effort to rise—merely sat there in the
sunshine with young life rioting over her and
round her and smiled up at the stranger out
of clear, fearless, brown eyes that were used
to greeting friends. There was no room
for doubt. This was Pegeen’s Smiling
Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald’s cap was in his hand. Apology
was on his lips, but looking down at the group,
he laughed instead of apologizing. Babies,
puppies, kittens—all were staring at him
solemnly, uncertainly. The collie was staring,
too, with more dignity and with deeper
suspicion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the Smiling Lady accepted him without
reserve, had no doubts about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We came after flowers,” she said. “At
least we intended to get flowers, but there were
so many of us, and some of us had such short
legs, and all of us except Sandy had such vagabond,
inconsequent souls, that we just sat
down and rolled around in flowers instead of
picking them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been sketching. At least I intended
to sketch,” Archibald paraphrased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. The laugh was as satisfactory
in its way as the smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s that kind of a day,” she admitted
lazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved a wandering puppy and a kitten
or two, to make room for the man on the
grassy bank beside her, but there was no coquetry
in the invitation—merely a matter-of-fact
acceptance of another companion less reliable
than the collie perhaps, less amusing
than the puppies and kittens and babies, but
doubtless well meaning. There was June
joy enough for all comers, and she was no
monopolist. And when Archibald had
stretched himself out on his back beside her,
she evidently considered her responsibility
ended, took his well being and content for
granted, and went back to playing with her
young things. The young things, after their
first surprise, accepted him in much the same
tranquil way. Only Sandy, the collie, maintained
a haughty aloofness, stood manifestly
on guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the kittens made a tentative excursion
along the man’s recumbent form and
curled up in a soft ball on his chest. A puppy
of inquiring and friendly turn of mind chewed
two or three of the newcomer’s fingers in turn,
then gamboled awkwardly up to his head and
licked his cheek with a warm, wet tongue. A
chubby, laughing baby in sadly faded and
much patched blue rompers filled her hot
little hands with Quaker ladies and scattered
them painstakingly over the front of the artist’s
flannel shirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Ophelia,” murmured Archibald.
“Or perhaps I should say Hamlet,”
he added doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady rescued a kitten from the
strangle hold of the other diminutive being in
blue rompers, and cleared up the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s simply no telling in rompers,” she
said. “But that’s Rosamond strewing flowers
over you and this is Jeremiah. They’re
the Johnston twins, four years old and very
active, thank you. Father Johnston is religious
and Mother Johnston is romantic and
each one named a baby, but I do think Mr. Johnston
might have picked out one of the
cheerful prophets. Jerry isn’t a bit of a
wailer. Jerry and Rosy aren’t such bad little
names for them, though, are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good little names,” protested Archibald.
“But how do you know which child
belongs to which name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have to go by manners, not by looks,”
the Smiling Lady explained. “Now if
Jerry’s attention had been concentrated upon
you, he wouldn’t have strewn flowers over
you. He’d probably have bitten your thumb
or poked a finger in your eye. You see,
Jerry’s on the way to being a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thumb-biting, eye-poking class, I
gather?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forceful, let us put it—and yet so helpless,
poor things! How is Pegeen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The connection is obvious,” Archibald
confessed. “I am wax in her hands. Within
a week there won’t be a paint brush in the
shack that I can call my own. She’s going to
keep me tidy if she has to drive me from home
in order to do it. In fact, she did drive me
from home this morning. She’s cleaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll take very good care of you,” said the
Smiling Lady, “and <span class='it'>how she will</span> love doing
it! She’ll mother you as if you were Jerry’s
age. Peggy was born for mothering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had risen as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sandy and I must take all these babies
home before they begin clamoring for food,”
she said lightly, “and I haven’t a doubt but
that Peggy is watching the meadow path for
you. Give her my love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took it for granted that he knew her as
she knew him. Pegeen was sure to have
talked of her and so why bother with formalities?
Yet, in spite of her frank acceptance of
him, Archibald did not offer to walk home
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a definite finality about her leave-taking,
a door quietly shut. Evidently this
unconventional Young Woman made her own
laws and limitations, and Archibald, being no
dullard in feminine psychology, realized that
the man who presumed upon her casual
friendliness would be likely to find the door
permanently closed. So he stood quietly and
watched her going away across the sunshiny
glade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked as she spoke, as she looked, as
she smiled, with a fine freedom, a blithe assurance;
and though the figure that swayed so
lightly as it went away between the birches
was girlishly slender, there was a subtle hint
of strength and vigor in its flowing lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Archibald looked, she stooped to one of
the babies, and the man drew a sharp breath
of appreciation, noting with an artist’s eye, the
gracious curves of her breast under the clinging
muslin blouse, the rhythmic length of
limb, the modeling of the bare forearms, the
well-set head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she gathered the child into her arms,
tossed it high before cuddling it close against
her shoulder, and went on her way as swiftly
and lightly as though unburdened, the watcher
sighed with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still thinking of her as he leaped the
wall into his own meadow and swung his cap
over his head, in answer to the greeting waved
to him by a little figure in the doorway of the
shack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much beautiful,” he summed up,
“as made up of beauties. She’d never drive
a man mad, but, holy smoke, what a delight
she might be to him in his sane moments.”</p>

<h1 id='t1181'>III</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy,” said John Archibald, leaning
his elbows on the breakfast table, “sit
down and let me talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl who was headed toward the
kitchen turned back promptly and sat down
across the table from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she waited tranquilly for him to talk
to her. What he had to say might be unimportant.
It usually was, but she liked his
talk. As she had already explained to the
Smiling Lady, it was “so sort of foolish and
snarky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day, however, he seemed inclined to
seriousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to put things on a business
basis, child,” he said firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,”—Pegeen’s tone was docile but
vastly indifferent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been seeing to me for a week now
and you know the worst about me. Now the
question is, whether you are going to take the
job for the summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark blue Irish eyes under Peg’s black
lashes flooded with anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I suit, sir?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You suit like an easy shoe, Peggy; but do
I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thin, freckled, little face blazed into
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I think you’re splendid, sir—just
splendid. Funny, you know, and messy, but
I don’t mind that. I love cleaning up after
folks if they’re nice, and you’re as nice as
can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Archibald, gratefully.
“Then you think you can keep on seeing to
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yessir. I’d love it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the work isn’t too hard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard? Why, it isn’t a bit hard. If
anybody isn’t sick or drunk or anything like
that, seeing to him is as easy as anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m feeling fairly healthy,”—Archibald’s
voice was grave—“and I’ll try not to get
drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, then we’ll get along fine, sir.
Of course I’d do my best, even if you did get
sick or drunk, but it’s lots harder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think it might be. Now the next
thing to be settled is, what your wages are to
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wouldn’t expect wages—not real
wages, you know. Just enough to get me
some shoes and some aprons. I’d like some
big clean-looking aprons that would hide my
dresses. My dresses aren’t so very nice, you
know, but they’d do under aprons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss O’Neill,”—Archibald shook a forefinger
at her sternly—“I won’t allow any one
to see to me without paying her real wages.
I couldn’t be funny and messy with any comfort
at all unless there was a wage earner to
clean up after me. Now I don’t know how
wages go in this Valley, but what would you
say to five dollars a week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen stared at him in blank amazement.
Then a pitying expression blotted out the surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly do need seeing to,” she said
gently, in the tone of one humoring the harmless
insane. “Why, you can get real hired
help for five dollars; but, then, a man
wouldn’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got more than hired help. I’ve got
somebody who does all the work. I’ve got
a cook and a housekeeper and a valet and a
companion. Now, for the services of four experts
I don’t consider five dollars an exorbitant
wage. So that’s settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vivid little face across the table was
flushed, excited. It occurred to the man that
if the thin cheeks should take on plumpness
and the sharp little chin should fill out to
rounded curves, and the unchildish, anxious
look should quite die out of the great eyes,
Pegeen might some day be amazingly pretty.
Even as it was, there was an appealing charm
about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’ll I ever do with all that money?”
she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy a coach and four with it,” advised
Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her imagination was all aflame at the suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Black horses and the coach lined with yellow,
and we’ll take Miss Moran and the
Johnston twins and Mrs. Neal and Mrs. Benderby
and Jimmy Dawes, and the McKenzie
baby and—How many does a coach
hold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, unless it’s a very large coach, I
should say you’ve got it about full.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Can you drive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll sit on the front seat with Miss
Moran.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hooray!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the rest of us will be behind with red
and green umbrellas, and there’ll be chains
that jingle on the horses and Jimmy Dawes
will blow a horn—I saw a coach go by down
the road once. It was perfectly splendid.
Now there isn’t anything but automobiles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you’d rather buy an automobile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’d as leave have a sawmill as one of
them. An automobile wouldn’t fit into a
fairy story, now would it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald visibly made an effort to fit one
in and, failing, shook his head despairingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There I told you. We’ve got to have the
coach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sensitive face was lighted from brow
to chin with merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes. She unquestionably would be pretty.
She was pretty even now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you <span class='it'>are</span> nice,” she sighed happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man reached across the table and
clasped the thin little hands in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was good to give happiness—almost better
than being happy. Maybe it was the same
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before we get the coach and four,” he said,
“we’ll hire Mrs. Neal’s horse and buggy and
drive to Pittsfield and when we get there we
will buy those shoes and aprons and some
dresses to go under the aprons and a hat—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With roses on it,” chanted Pegeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With roses on it,” agreed Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a raincoat for rainy mornings—and
stockings—and all sorts of things,” he ended
vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they aren’t to come out of the coach
money,” he added hastily. “Not a bit of it.
They are extra. You are going to have five
dollars a week and ‘found.’ ‘Found’ means
hats with roses on them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peg’s chin was nestled between her palms.
Her eyes were beaming on him. Suddenly
a cloud swept over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, sir,” she began and hesitated.
The cloud of anxiety had drifted over
the whole piquant face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, sir,” she began again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” encouraged the man across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure you can afford it, sir?” It
came out with a rush at last—“I’ve always
heard that artists—I don’t really need the
things. I’ve got plenty. I can get along
first rate with just the shoes and aprons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through Archibald’s mind drifted a fleeting
memory of the last gift he had sent to
Nadine Ransome. She loved emeralds and
many men had given them to her. A dull
flush came into his cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m quite sure I can afford it. You see I
had a father who didn’t paint pictures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, then—” said Peggy, understandingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go to Pittsfield on Saturday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pink roses,” stipulated the small girl, as
she carried the breakfast dishes kitchenward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big pink roses,” amended the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few days after his high-handed adjustment
of the wage problem, Archibald
painted with something like his old time fervor.
For two years, eye and hand and brain
had been out of tune; but now the beauty of
the world cried out to him again and his brush
caught and fixed the meaning of the cry.
Men had prophesied great things for him—men
who knew. He had believed in great
things for himself; but all that had been in the
time he could scarcely remember—in the
time before he had met Nadine. Since then
he had lost faith in himself and in much beside;
but now, standing before a finished picture
and knowing it was good, the painter admitted
to himself that life had its satisfactory
moments. Not that he was sure of himself.
He was far from it; but agreeable things <span class='it'>did</span>
happen. There was Pegeen and there was
the Smiling Lady and there was June—and
he had painted a good picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy,” he said, as the girl passed him on
her way to the spring, “God must have had a
mighty contented, comfortable feeling at the
end of the sixth day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yessir.” She had no idea what he meant,
but it was enough for her that he said a thing.
She was willing to swear to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put an affectionate hand upon her
shoulder as she came and stood beside him
looking at the picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand you’re a wonderful hand
with babies, Peg,” he said. “What do you
do with a baby when he’s cross or bad or
wants something he mustn’t have? Spank
him, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen flushed indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I should think not! If that’s all
you know about babies! Why, I just go to
work and get the poor little thing awfully interested
in something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald laughed boyishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy child. That must be the answer.
You’re getting me awfully interested in something
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only you weren’t bad, sir,” protested the
small girl, loyally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow crept over the man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad enough, Peg—but I might have been
worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re good enough for me,” said
Peggy, contentedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The comforting words rang pleasantly in
his ears a half hour later when he plunged
into the woods behind the shack and took the
trail leading up the steep slope of Pine Knob
hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day had been hot for June and the
dim cool greenness closed around him deliciously
as he made his way through depths
of hemlock shadow and gold-decked shallows
of birch-filtered light. There was a faint
stir of wind in the branches, a rustle of light
foot and lighter wing in the hidden places of
bough and undergrowth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and then, as he climbed, he caught,
through opening among the trees, sudden
glimpses of the Valley where the long
shadows of late afternoon were flinging themselves
across the sunlit breast of the meadow
land, and of the range of hills beyond, still
gold and green and blue, but with prophetic
splashes of deepening purple creeping in and
out among the ravines and hollows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would be in time to see the sunset from
the top of Pine Knob and, at the thought,
something Pegeen had said days before
flashed into his mind. There was “a place up
there where you could look out and out,” and
the Smiling Lady often went there to watch
the sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald told himself that it would be a
pleasant thing to find her there. She was the
sort of woman with whom one could watch a
miracle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so when, pushing aside a screen of
thick crowding leaves, he found her sitting
on a mossy stone, elbow on knee, chin in hand,
eyes a-dream, he was not surprised, only glad
that the human note could intrude on Nature’s
melody without discord. She fitted in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re just in time,” she said, looking up
at him for an instant in friendly fashion.
Then her eyes went back to the fields and hills
and sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a curious way of making one feel
welcome without bothering to put the thing
into words. Archibald remembered that it
had been the same when he had found her in
the birch wood.—There had been the same
undisturbed acceptance of his coming, the
same companionable assumption of his content.
There was no aloofness about her
mood. Before she had been absorbed in
frolicking with babies. Now she was absorbed
in the sunset. She took his interest
in the babies and in the sunset for granted,
shared them with him, and felt that she had
fulfilled her duty. There was something
oddly intimate about such a welcome. Archibald
puzzled over it, as he dropped on the
moss beside her and ostensibly gave his undivided
attention to the sunset. If she had been
startled or formal or coquettish or resentful—those
were the beginnings of acquaintance
between a man and a woman; but this girl’s
life and his might have been running side by
side for years. All the futile, tentative things
might have been said so long ago that they
could be forgotten. There was suggestion of
a long lane traversed, of barriers passed, about
this taking-for-granted companioning. And
yet the splendid simplicity of it put a man in
his place, made him feel humbly grateful,
eager to be found worthy. He wondered
whether she met all strangers in the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though she had heard his thoughts, the
girl turned to him for a moment, looked at
him frankly, appraisingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One knows that you won’t spoil it,” she
said, the ripple of light that was like the soul
of a smile running over her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that was it? Archibald felt enormously
flattered. To be recognized at sight by a girl
with a smile like that as the sort of man who
would not spoil beautiful things, seemed exceedingly
worth while. To be good enough
for Pegeen and to be understanding enough
for the Smiling Lady—honors were coming
thick and fast upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he justified the girl’s faith in him
by quite forgetting her in the glory of the sunset
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no mad riot of crimson and gold
in the west. Above the tops of the crouching
hills masses of rose-lined clouds with flame
at their hearts melted into opal as they dared
the sky heights. Bars of palest turquoise
gathered the opaline blues to themselves; and,
higher still, the faint green faded from the
blue, leaving an eastern sea of pale pure azure
through which a silver crescent drifted,
tangled in foam spume of delicate pink cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually the color died away. The
young moon dropped behind the eastern hills.
Ashen grays and violets and liquid, indefinite,
blue blacks claimed the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady stirred and rose. Archibald
joined her and together they went silently
down the sweet, scented ways of the
dew-wet dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll come in,” she said when they
reached a small white farmhouse nestled under
great maples. He followed her into a
candle-lighted room where Sandy, the collie,
and an elderly woman with a shrewd, homely
face rose from before the open fire to greet
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Archibald will be having tea with me,
Ellen,” said the Smiling Lady, quite as though
having tea with her were a life-long habit of
the man’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen took one swift, comprehensive look
at the visitor as she carried the girl’s coat from
the room. The respectful look of a well-trained
servant it was, yet Archibald had a
feeling that he had been catalogued and the
record tucked away in a card index.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen plays the rôle of a dragon,” Miss
Moran explained lightly, “a non-sulphurous
dragon. It seems the most independent
young woman must offer up concessions to
tradition in the form of a dragon—and then I
couldn’t get along without Ellen. She was
my nurse once upon a time; my mother’s housekeeper
afterward. She would not go away
with the others—will never go away until she
makes the long journey. Money has nothing
to do with such service as she gives me. We
share what I have and she’s family and friend
and servant all in one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are fortunate to have her,” the man
said gently. She nodded. For an instant
there was no hint of a smile in her face and
Archibald felt as though the candles in the
room had suddenly burned out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s the only one now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a hurt in her voice, but the next
moment she was calling gaily through the
half-open door to Ellen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jam, Ellen! Plum jam, with the scones—plenty
of it—and in here, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Ellen had moved a wicker table
to a place before the fire, covered it with the
whitest of cloths and set upon it a tray on
which a teapot steamed merrily and a salad
nestled temptingly among cresses and a covered
muffin dish made promises and the plum
jam glowed colorfully, the girl in the big
wicker chair across the table from Archibald
was all cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy gives you dinners perhaps?” she
queried. “Women folk fall into picnicing
ways when there are no men about the house
to be considered, and I never let meals interfere
with sunsets, so I have my tea whenever
I come in. Of course we don’t really need
an open fire to-night, but I love it so and, thank
Heaven, even the summer nights are usually
cool enough for it, so I sit here in the evenings
and sip and munch and tell over the day’s doings—and,
once in a while, I send a pitying
thought toward all the folk who are eating
dinners in rose-and-gilt city restaurants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor wretches,” murmured Archibald,
sinking back luxuriously among his cushions
and looking around him at the low ceilinged
room with its gay chintz and wicker and old
mahogany, its companioning books and pictures,
its great bowls of June flowers and
greenery. A friendly room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes came back to the mistress of it,
and rested there contentedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was busying herself with the tea and he
had always liked to watch a pretty woman
pouring tea. Not that this woman was pretty.
He discarded the word fastidiously. She
was something better than pretty, something
much more satisfying. Candle light and firelight
touched the waves of her thick rippling
hair to something like burnished copper, but
it was deeply auburn in its shadows. Sun and
wind had had their way with her clear skin,
had tanned it, had even freckled it—but tenderly,
mellowing white to cream, rose flush to
ripened peach, splashing a nose far from
classic with the faintest of brown touches,
melting almost invisibly into the sun warmed
tan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mouth was over-large by artist’s canons,
but sweetness lurked in its curves and the
generous mobile lips were warmly red. And
her eyes—Archibald puzzled vainly over
their color. Hazel, he had thought them at
first sight, but as they looked at him across the
tea cups they looked deeply gray—or were
they violet in their shadows?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friends—the people who <span class='it'>were</span> my
friends in my rose-and-gilt restaurant days—think
I am quite mad because I live up here
the year round,” she was saying. “There’s
no making them understand that I like it. I
tried at first but they insisted upon being sorry
for me and that’s a great strain on friendship,
you know. So now we exchange pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve lived here a long time?” asked
Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five years. I had no idea of staying when
I came. This old farm had come into my
father’s hands years before and one summer
Mother and I had fixed it up a bit and spent
part of a summer in it. It was one of the few
things that was left after my father’s death.
I came away here for healing,—and I found
it—after a time—here among my hills and my
own people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your own people?” the man echoed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; they <span class='it'>are</span> mine now. The hills and
the sky and the fields and the woods began my
cure—taught me that beauty hadn’t died because
I was unhappy, but it was neighboring
that taught me to be happy again. We’re
a selfish lot with our loves, aren’t we? I had
been quite contented with my half dozen out
of the world. The rest didn’t count for me.
They were just chorus—merry villagers, you
know—quite unimportant except for stage effect.
Then when I was left alone, I found
that I needed those others—and that they
needed me. After I learned that lesson, I
put away sorrow. One doesn’t forget, of
course. One misses always; but one loves and
helps and is glad. It’s a joyful old world,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spots.” The man’s voice was dubious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait until you’ve adopted the Valley,”
advised the girl, laughingly. “You’ve made
a splendid beginning with Peggy. In the
meantime, Ellen’s bringing hot scones and
more plum jam. Who says this is a vale of
tears?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has its smiling moments,” confessed the
doubting one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked of many things there beside
the flickering fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl and her father had roamed the
world in the days before he left her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were alone together after Mother
died,” she said, “and he was restless always,
though he kept laughter on his lips; so we
went here and there, drifting back to New
York now and again. He was the best of
comrades and welcome everywhere. Dear
old Dad! All the world made friends with
him. He was Irish. Did I tell you that before?
Clever, irresponsible, adorable Irish.
Peggy and I have a bond in our Irish blood,
but I’ve none of the brogue. The pity of it!
Father’s was creamy, always. You should
have heard him tell an Irish story—and seen
him tell it! No wonder it’s easy for me to
be happy even now that he’s gone from me.
I learned the way of it from him, though all
the time he’d the broken heart over my mother’s
going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was talking half to herself now, and
smiling into the fire as though she had forgotten
the listening man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were in New York when he went away
from me,” she said. “I couldn’t believe that
he was very ill. He had always been so alive—so
splendidly, buoyantly alive. It seemed
to me that, in the end, he would laugh at death
and beat it off; but he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One afternoon he put out his hand to me
and laughed—his gay laugh that I always
loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m leaving you little except my blessing,
Acushla,’ he said. ‘But you can’t say I
haven’t given you a bully good time for a
while.’ Then he went to sleep smiling, and
that was the end of it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not tell the thing sadly—had even
a tender little laugh for the characteristic last
words of the reckless, merry father she had
loved so dearly; but there was a lump in
Archibald’s throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had made him free of something more
intimate than her birch glade or her sunset,
and he thanked her for it in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk drifted away from personalities
after that. She gave him bits of Valley history—humorous
chiefly, though now and then
pathos or tragedy showed its head, as it will
wherever human lives are in question. She
sang to him too, sweet old Irish love songs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you should have heard Daddy sing
them,” she said. “He had a voice made just
for love songs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was all aglow with interest and enthusiasm
when he told her of the expedition to
Pittsfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the fun of it,” she crowed jubilantly.
“I’ve so longed to get things for her—loads
of things—but I couldn’t. There are so many
who are in worse need of the little I can do.
Did she tell you that I did try to give her a
home here when her father disappeared?
She wouldn’t come. It wasn’t that she
didn’t love me. She made that very clear;
but she said that, being well and having Ellen,
I didn’t need her. She was ever so much
obliged to me but she thought she’d just see
to Mrs. Potter and the babies. The Potters
were so shiftless. You may be thankful that
your artist ways earned you a reputation for
shiftlessness here in the Valley. You’d never
have had Peggy if you had seemed capable of
taking care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a list of things for Pegeen’s outfit—necessaries
that began where dresses and
aprons ended, and she tried hard to reconcile
consideration for Archibald’s purse with zeal
for Pegeen’s welfare, conscientiously cutting
down first extravagant flights of imagination
regarding underwear and stockings and then
soaring recklessly into the realm of superfluities
after a parasol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peg has always been crazy for a parasol,”
she explained shamefacedly, “but of course it
isn’t really a necessity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The things one is crazy for are the only
necessities,” protested Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She beamed upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Irish in you, somewhere.” Her
eyes welcomed him as one of her blood.
“Now most of these New England folk have
never even suspected that great truth.
They’ve an idea that being crazy for a thing
damns it. They’ll look upon a pink parasol
for Peggy as a folly. Some of them will look
upon it as a sin—but how Peg will adore it!
I’d certainly cut down on something useful
and uninteresting and buy her a pink parasol.
Not an expensive one, you know. That would
be silly, because it wouldn’t make her any
happier than a cheap one and happiness is the
measure of excuse for folly, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was blithely sure of it, waved doubts
away with a careless hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Real happiness, of course. Not the Sodom’s
apple kind. The moment the apples begin
to taste Sodomy, one must quit being foolish
for the price beyond that is too high for
defective apples; but as long as folly really
makes us happy we’re wise fools. I’ve
bought my pink parasols in all kinds of markets
and never grudged the underwear and
stockings they cost me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t drive over to Pittsfield with
us,” suggested the man, tentatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Peggy’s day. I’d spoil it for her.
She’s going off alone with a fairy prince and
with Aladdin’s lamp tucked under the buggy
seat and she’d much better choose foolishly
for herself than have some one choose wisely
for her—not that I’d be wise. I’m all for
pink parasols myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked it. Archibald admitted that to
himself as he studied the laughing face over
which the candle light flickered softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incidentally he made a mental note to the
effect that Edison should be pilloried by
womankind. Even the rarest of beauties lost
charm under an electric glare, while in candle-light
hair and eyes and lips and throat took on
alluring mysteries—little half lights of confession,
swift, fleeting, golden, high lights of
revelation. The Smiling Lady’s radiant serenity
dissolved into witchery there in the
candle light. A dimple the man had not noticed
before quivered in her left cheek, disappeared,
came back into view. Elusive reservations
had crept into the candid eyes. A <span class='it'>very</span>
pink parasolish Young Person indeed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald hastily revised certain impressions
having to do with Olympian detachment
Altogether human, this Lady of the Smiles.
No Young Goddess, but half child, half
woman, and wholly lovely. It was all wrong
that she should be stranded here at the world’s
end, among alien folk, that she should be
alone save for an old servant, shut away in the
heyday of her youth from a world where pink
parasols flaunted bravely up and down, gay
winding ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, oddly enough, a trail of faces drifted
through his memory, women’s faces seen
against rose-colored backgrounds on those
same gay winding ways, and following them
came a vision of the Smiling Lady, sitting
among flowers and long grasses in a sunlit,
woodland glade with young life tumbling
round her. No, it wasn’t possible to pity her.
After all, there were pink parasols—and pink
parasols.</p>

<h1 id='t1964'>IV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen’s day dawned radiantly, a perfect
June day of sun-warmed breezes and
drifting, white clouds against an ardent, azure
sky, and the small girl was as radiant as the
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t sleep for thinking of it,” she
said happily, as she brought in Archibald’s
breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she was silent, watching as
usual with an anxious little frown while he
broke the shell of the two-minute eggs, but
when the ordeal was past and she once more
made sure that fire and water had not betrayed
her, she went on talking. Breakfast was always
a conversational interlude at the shack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dreamed a dreadful dream about you
getting over to Pittsfield and not having any
money and I cried so it waked me up, and then
I got to thinking maybe it was a warning or
something, so I prayed like fury. Mr. Colby,
the minister down in the village, says we
oughtn’t to pray for what we want, that we
ought to pray for grace to want what the Lord
thinks best for us to have, but it seems to me
that’s a silly way to pray. When we’ve got a
thing we’ve just got to make the best of it and
that’s all there is to it, but I believe in getting
to work early and praying for something it’ll
be easy to make the best of. I told God that
if anything horrid <span class='it'>was</span> going to happen I
wished to goodness He’d stave it off till after
I had my hat, and I think He will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing horrid is going to happen.”
Archibald spoke with the assurance of one
who has inside information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to have the time of our young
lives, Peggy. Never mind the dishes this
morning. You can do them to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, please. That’s a poor way. I’d
rather do them. Like as not, if I didn’t a
greasy plate would pop into my mind just
when I was trying on my hat and spoil things.
It’s perfectly terrible to have disagreeable
things jump out at you when everything’s
pleasant as can be. I’d lots rather clean up
as I go along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if you can’t wash your dirty dishes,
Peg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s tone was queer, though he
smiled, and the girl, sensitive to undercurrents,
looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” she said and there was a comforting
note in her own voice, “when I simply
can’t, I just put them to soak in soapy water
and try to forget them. It’s wonderful how
easy they are to do after a little if you let them
soak while you go off and do something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I suppose so.” He was evidently
doubtful. “Well, we’re not in a mad rush,
so clean up as you go along. It’s a good
habit, but I always seem to have dirty dishes
left over. Come down to Neals’ when you
are ready. I’m going to get the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half hour later the two drove down the
Valley road, while Mrs. Neal leaned over her
front gate to watch them go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old buggy was shabby, the old horse
was physically and temperamentally incapable
of anything more spirited than a jog-trot; but
Pegeen could not have been prouder, more
rapturous, if she had been taking the road with
the coach and four of her dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her faded blue dress had been washed and
starched to aggressive crispness. Her heavy
mop of black curls was tied with the cherished
pink hair ribbons that had been the Smiling
Lady’s last Christmas present. Under the
battered old straw hat whose rose-wreathed
successor was waiting in Pittsfield for
Pegeen’s coming, the expressive face was all
aflame with excitement and happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald looked down into the dark blue
eyes that were well-springs of bubbling joy,
and felt oddly young himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it splendid,” the small girl said
breathlessly—“going off on an adventure this
way, just you and me in a buggy. I’ve been
twice before, but in a wagon both times.
That was nice too, but a buggy’s so much
eleganter. I do hope they’ll all see us. Mrs.
Benderby’s washing at the Pratts’ to-day. I
told her we were going to start at nine, so
she’ll be looking out for us and like as not
she’s told everybody else, so they’ll all be
watching. Folks here in the Valley are awfully
interested in things and they’ve been
sort of excited about my going up to take care
of you. You see they couldn’t tell how it’d
turn out, you being from New York and an
artist and not smiling at anybody, and all that,
but now when they see me driving to Pittsfield
with you in a buggy and you looking so jolly
and nice, they’ll know that everything’s
come out beautifully. I knew it would all
the time ’n’ Miss Moran said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Peg, everybody knows how to smile at
the world, but some people are dreadfully out
of practice.’ She said when you found out
there were other folks in the world beside
yourself maybe you’d smile at them, and now
you’re beginning to do it. When you get real
well acquainted with everybody here in the
Valley, I shouldn’t wonder if you’d simply
grin. There’s Mrs. Ransom and Sally on
their side stoop, watching for us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bounced joyously on the hard leather
seat and waved both hands wildly toward two
women, who waved answering salutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Ransom’s a deacon and he won’t let
Sally go anywhere except to church, or have
beaux or anything. Don’t you think it’s a
shame—and she’s pretty as a picture too, and
all the boys are perfectly crazy about her.
Her mother’s just like a scared little white
rabbit—pale blue eyes and wrinkly little nose
and everything. The neighbors say she’s
afraid to breathe and Sally doesn’t stand up
to her father because he takes it out on her
mother and Mrs. Ransom’s so afraid. Miss
Moran’s about the only one that dares to go
there much, but she isn’t afraid of anything
and Deacon Ransom can’t be perfectly nasty
to her. Nobody can. Why, even Bill
Briggs, that drinks so and swears something
awful at everybody, he’s got to be real friendly
with Miss Moran. She hurt her ankle one
day climbing a fence down by the back road
and Bill Briggs happened to come along. He
wasn’t so very drunk, but anybody else would
have been scared half to death of him. Miss
Moran just upped and called to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, Mr. Briggs,’ she said, ‘I’m so glad
you came along. I’ve hurt myself and I’ll
have to get you to help me home.’ He told
folks that he cussed once or twice from habit,
but she looked so nice and friendly and so glad
he was there and so sure he was going to fix
things for her, that he went over and helped
her up and took her home—carried her the
last part of the way—and when they got to
the house she made him come in and have dinner
and now he’s sobered up some and he
works for her a good deal, but he doesn’t talk
hardly at all when he’s around there. He
can’t talk without swearing and he doesn’t
like to swear before her, so you’d most think
he was deaf and dumb when he’s working at
her place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drive down the Valley was a continuous
performance of waving greetings, and running
commentary. Pegeen did not gossip. She
simply overflowed; and Archibald found the
people of whom she talked taking very definite
shape in his mind. He felt distinctly interested
in pretty Sally Ransom and profane
Bill Briggs and Ginsy Shalloway, the seamstress,
who went around sewing and knew all
about everybody, and Ezra Watts who wasn’t
respectable and was suspected of stealing
everything that disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Really, the country wasn’t the lonely place
Archibald had always believed it to be. It
was full of people and of drama. And though
the man had run away from women and men
and vowed himself to misanthropic seclusion,
his Valley neighbors seen through Pegeen’s
friendly, tolerant eyes seemed likable folk.
Even Ezra Watts, the not respectable, got the
benefit of Peg’s doubt. “It’s handy to have
somebody to lay things on,” she said. “’N’ I
guess Ezra gets credit for lots of things he
doesn’t do—like when Mr. Sanderson was
sure his saw and auger had been stolen and
then one day old Granny Sanderson had a
dream that they were under the bed springs
and sure enough there they were on the cords,
where Mr. Sanderson had left them himself
when he’d been fixing the bed. Ezra’s got
a terrier dog, Bingo, that loves him like everything,
and Miss Moran says when Bingo turns
his back on Ezra, she’ll believe the man’s as
bad as he’s painted, but not till then. It’s
awfully hard for Miss Moran to believe anybody’s
bad, ’n’ I guess mostly they aren’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the main street of Pisgah, the little village
at the end of the Valley, Pegeen suddenly
bounced higher than usual on the buggy seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—please—there’s Jimmy. Oh, do
stop, Mr. Archibald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sturdy, barefooted boy sat on the stone
wall under a spreading maple tree, whittling
nonchalantly and with an air of profound indifference
to passersby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy,” called Pegeen eagerly, “Jimmy
Dawes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy looked up from his whittling,
showing two merry brown eyes and a most engaging
grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Lo,” he conceded, trying to look as if he
had not been watching for Pegeen’s triumphal
progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned out from the buggy, glowing,
eager, sure of sympathy, in spite of the apparent
lack of enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to Pittsfield, Jimmy. I’m going
to have a new hat—with pink roses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy Dawes’ eyes sought Archibald’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t girls the limit?” he said genially, as
man to brother man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Pegeen refused to be suppressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’N’ a new dress ’n’ shoes!” she confided
happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy, having asserted the superiority of
his sex, like many a male creature before him,
felt that he could afford to humor the inferior
feminine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s great!” he said with warm friendliness.
“You’ll look fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen beamed upon him. “I knew you’d
be glad,” she said. “This is Mr. Archibald,
Jimmy. I’m seeing to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grin on the boy’s face widened to show
more of his white teeth. There was something
refreshingly wholesome about the
soundness and whiteness of those teeth, the
amplitude of the grin, the clear frankness of
the eyes, the tanned ruddiness of the skin, the
sturdiness of his two brown legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you’ll get seen to all right, if Peg’s
on the job,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down and see us, Jimmy,” urged
Pegeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do. Come down and go fishing with
me,” added Archibald, and then wondered at
himself for having said it. He had never
cared for small boys—nor for small girls.
Come to think of it, he had never really known
any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I’ll show you some dandy
pools.” Jimmy’s acceptance was prompt and
blithe. He was used to comradeship and confident
that Peg wouldn’t vouch for an undesirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s the nicest boy,” Archibald’s companion
explained as they drove away.
“Mostly they pester, you know, but Jimmy
doesn’t. He treats you as if you were another
boy ’n’ when you can’t do things, he sort of
pretends it’s because you don’t want to ’n’ the
other boys don’t dare be horrid when he’s
around ’cause he can do most everything better
than they can, and he licked every single
one of them—when he first came. He said he
didn’t do it because he was mad, but just to
show them and get it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hasn’t always lived here then?” asked
Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. He just stays with his grandfather
and grandmother. His father married
again down in New York ’n’ I guess
Jimmy missed his mother ’n’ then his father
didn’t think cities were good for boys, ’n’
old Mrs. Dawes adores Jimmy, ’n’ so he’s going
to live here for awhile. Mr. Colby—the
minister, you know—teaches him queer things
like Latin and algebra ’n’ some day he’ll have
to go away and be educated and rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her lips drooped woefully at the thought—but
reassurances came quickly. “He says
he’s such an awful dub at Latin that he won’t
be ready for college for years ’n’ years.
That’s lucky anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road left the Valley behind and climbed
skyward between lines of wonderfully built
stone walls that had little in common with the
vagabond, straggling stone heaps that marked
property confines in the Valley. Behind the
walls orchards clung to the sloping hillsides—old
orchards that gave evidences of early
care and training but were lapsing from grace
in their latter days. They had not been able
to live up to the walls that enclosed them, yet
the broad spreading trees had a dignity of
their own. They were decaying but they had
given bountifully in their day. One felt that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men who built these walls were in
earnest,” Archibald said reflectively as he
eyed the width and height of them, their perfect
alignment, their broad level tops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shakers,” she explained. “I guess they’re
always awfully in earnest, only they used to
build fences ’n’ now they mostly pray. You
see there don’t seem to be many men with
them now and women have got to pray when
they’re in earnest. They can’t build walls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be one way of building walls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw what he meant. Pegeen usually
saw what people meant. That was one reason
she was such a comforting small person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know, but it’s sort of nice to leave
walls standing up to show for years ’n’ years.
Women bake ’n’ scrub ’n’ wash dishes ’n’ the
next day it’s all gone and has to be done over
again. The Shaker women are working like
sixty and they’re perfectly splendid at praying,
but the farms are running down. I do
think it’s sort of discouraging being a woman—but
I like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless your heart!” There was a tenderness
for more than the child in Archibald’s
eyes as he looked down into the sensitive,
glowing face—a sudden tenderness for all the
dear women who found their womanhood discouraging,
yet gloried in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faces looked out through the shining windows
of the great brick buildings as the man
and girl drove through the Shaker village—sweet,
kindly faces that smiled in return to
Pegeen’s waving hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re such dears,” she said enthusiastically.
“They wanted me to come up here
when I didn’t have anybody, but I’d rather
come sometimes for a little while and then go
away where the folks aren’t so holy and clean
all the time. I love them to death and it’s
terribly noble to go off and not get married
and wear scoop bonnets and keep your floors
as white as chalk, but I guess I’m not noble
inside—’n’ anyway, if all the women went off
and were holy and clean who’d see to the dirty
and unholy folks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy,” said Archibald, earnestly, urgently,
“if you should ever feel an attack of
cleanly holiness coming on—the noble kind—fight
it off. Take something for it. We unholy
dirty sinners need you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry.” Pegeen’s tone was reassuring.
“I’m not going to wear a scoop bonnet—not
while there are hats with pink roses on
them—but the Shakers are darlings all the
same. Miss Moran just loves them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a very loving person.” There was
an edge of criticism in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen thought it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she is,” she admitted finally. “She
loves most anybody—but then there are a few
she loves <span class='it'>especially</span> and that’s quite different.
It’s like being loved by a foreign missionary
and being loved by your mother, you know.
I’d lots rather be loved because I was nice
than because I was a human soul, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would,” assented Archibald with fervor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Susy, the Neal horse, had been intrusted
to the tender care of a livery stable
hostler in Pittsfield and the two whom she had
brought from over the hills turned their faces
toward Ranson and Kirby’s Dry Goods Emporium,
Pegeen’s feet absolutely refused to
conduct themselves sedately. Skip they
would, in spite of all of her ideas of seemly
behavior. Four sedate steps and then a skip
was the final compromise, and in order to
achieve that Peg had to anchor to something
substantial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped a small brown hand into her
companion’s large one and looked up at him
with dancing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I don’t hold on to something, I’ll go up
like a balloon,” she confided. “I don’t feel
as if I weighed anything—especially my feet
’n’ my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald squeezed the small hand tightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Pegeen O’Neill, if you should let
your feet float up and your head thump down,
I should consider you a Young Person unfit
to be trusted with a hat trimmed in pink
roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She chuckled gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But think of the chance the new shoes and
stockings would have,” she urged. “I guess
I can stay down though, if you don’t let go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went into the shop hand in hand.
Salesfolk and customers looked at the pair—and
looked again, and smiled—kindly smiles,
touched with curiosity. The two were so
oddly mated—the tall lean man with his clean-cut,
homely, clever face, his air of authority,
his loose-hanging, irreproachably-cut, well-worn
tweeds, the slim shabby little girl with
happiness flooding her eyes, dimpling her
cheeks, playing over her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t she a good feeler though!” a blonde
at the ribbon counter remarked to the girl next
to her. “Makes you ache to see anybody as
pleased with things as all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I c’d be sort of pleased with his Nibs myself,”
admitted the friend. “Nobody’s pretty
boy but kind of mannish and looks as if he
had the price, and c’d be parted from it if
he felt good and like it. Guess he’s feelin’
like it all right too. Wonder who they are?
The kid’s in right. Anybody c’n see that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald, still holding Pegeen’s hand,
appealed to a stately and suave floorwalker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to do some shopping for this young
lady,” he explained—“a good deal of shopping,
and I’m hopelessly incapable. Now
you must have some woman about the place
who could take us in hand—sort of advisory
committee, pilot, first-aid rôle, some one with
good sense and good taste. We’re strong on
taste ourselves but we’re not so sure of our
sense, eh, Peg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She beamed up at him and then transferred
the beam to the floorwalker who melted into
a semblance of human interest and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Miss Carter’s just what you need,” he
said. “I’ll send for her. She’ll be invaluable.
I’d go with you myself, only duty—and
of course a woman—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” agreed Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our Miss Carter materialized as a plump
little woman with a firm chin, a pleasant voice,
and kindly brown eyes behind eyeglasses.
She understood the situation at once, without
fuss, without debate. Archibald gave her
Miss Moran’s list and she read it gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hat and the parasol seem to be the
most important things,” she said without hesitation.
“Suppose we get them first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen’s hand squeezed Archibald’s ecstatically.
Here was a sensible, intelligent
person with a sense of values.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pink roses were not “large pink roses”
after all. Not that a heavily marcelled and
enameled daughter of Israel, under Miss Carter’s
stimulus, did not show the shoppers an
uncommonly fine line of enormous pink roses.
She was unflagging in her efforts. She called
Pegeen “my dear” from the start and after the
first few hats, bestowed an occasional “my
dear” upon Archibald, in her fine glow of
friendly feeling; but there was a certain mushroom-brimmed
little hat, faced in pink and
wreathed in wild roses, to which Pegeen lost
her heart utterly, irrevocably, at first sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re so darling and Valleyish,” she explained
to Archibald, and he understood what
she meant. Moreover, the piquant little face
and the wild-rose hat rimed in a way to satisfy
his artist soul and to strengthen his growing
conviction that Pegeen was headed toward
beauty and already well on the way. The
parasol was easily chosen—a pink one to match
the hat—but on the subject of frocks, there was
serious debate. Archibald centered his affections
upon a pink linen that Miss Carter
considered impracticable from the point of
view of laundering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course if she could afford to have a
great many,” she began. The artist waved
the laundry problem aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will take the pink one,” he announced
firmly, and Pegeen heaved a sigh of satisfaction,
though she had nobly sided with the advisory
committee on the subject of laundering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a couple of white things,” said Archibald,—“and
then be as practical as you please,
so long as practical doesn’t mean ugly.”
There were ten frocks in the pile when they
called a halt and Pegeen’s astonished eyes
were so widely, darkly blue that they seemed
to fill most of her face. “Now a coat and
raincoat,” prompted the Fairy Godfather,—and
when the coats were chosen, he felt in his
pockets for his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m through,” he said,—“you can run the
rest of the show, on your own, Miss Carter.
There’s the list, and you know what a girl her
age ought to have. Get her shoes big enough
and buy her everything she needs. Then I
want you to take her somewhere and put her
into the pink outfit—whole business; I’ll be
out in front when you get through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, as he sat on a nail-keg in
front of the hardware store next door, a vision
appeared to him—a vision in pink—a vision
of youth incarnate, all smiles and blushes,
and tremulous hope, and heart-clutching
fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, she turned round before him, once—twice.
Then she stood still and looked at
him anxiously from under the rose-wreathed
new hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like me?” she asked, her voice
high and wobbly from excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye gods!” he murmured feebly. “Is this
the young person who is seeing to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” she assured him hastily. “She’s
got work clothes too, but she’s adventuring
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Archibald, half seriously,
“in a few years, it will be a very perilous adventure
to look as pretty as all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went in to pay the bill and to thank
Miss Carter, who tried in vain to look as
though she had not been watching them
through the window and as though she were
not consumed by curiosity about them. Then
they strolled away down Main Street and once
more the little brown hand slipped into the
big brown one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t feel so skippy,” Pegeen explained,
“but my throat’s funny and I’ve got to squeeze
something. I wish I had the Johnston twins
here. They are so fat and soft and nice to
hug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the hotel where the two lunched, they
apparently created a ripple in the summer
crowd’s sea of dullness. Even the dowagers
and spinsters knitting on the long verandas
looked interested and dropped a stitch or two
as the apparition in pink lilted past them; and
when Pegeen, seated at a table in the big dining-room
smiled shyly, radiantly, confidingly,
at the world from under the brim of the rose-wreathed
hat, the world smiled back at her
without reservation. It was as though the
spirit of eternal youth had passed that way and
set even the most scarred world-worn hearts
beating to forgotten tunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child’s eyes were like stars, her cheeks
were pinker than her dainty frock. Happiness—unalloyed,
effervescent, illimitable happiness
enveloped her from the most aspiring
tendril of the wild rose wreath to the toe-tips
of the shining new shoes. And when she
looked across the table at the Fairy Godfather
in prosaic tweed, adoration elbowed rapture
in the look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got my legs twisted around the table
leg, so I can’t float up,” she told him, leaning
forward and speaking in confidential tones,
out of consideration for the waiter, “but I
wouldn’t be a mite surprised if something
would go bang, and I’d wake up at Mrs.
Benderby’s in my old blue gingham and find
out that I’d been dreaming you and the hat
and everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She behaved very prettily in spite of her
excitement. Watching her, Archibald found
himself thinking of what Mrs. Neal had said
about the frail, proud, little mother whom
love and life had broken. The hint of race
and breeding in Pegeen’s face must have come
from her—the dainty ways of the child too.
There was no awkwardness about the small
girl’s manner though this was her first introduction
to a hotel menu, a waiter’s service, a
crowd’s scrutiny. Archibald had wondered
often at the purity of her speech, which for all
its childish inconsequence held none of the
vulgarisms of the untrained, and now he realized
that her table manners, like her grammar,
must have had early and thorough attention.
Poor little mother, how she would
love the child now! How she must have
loved the father of the child when she tossed
her own world aside for him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking sorry!” said the girl across
the table from him. She was amazed—reproachful.
How was it possible for any one
to be sorry on such a day!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was being sorry for all the fairy god-fathers
whose godchildren aren’t exactly
like you, Peggy,” the man explained, and she
forgave him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drive home was quieter than that of the
morning. Pegeen was as happy as she had
been, but between the happiness of anticipation
and the happiness of content, the heart
travels far. She was satisfied now to lean
against the shabby, leather-covered back of
the buggy-seat and watch the shadows
lengthen across the meadows and steal silently
up towards the sun-gilded hilltops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once in a while she looked up at Archibald
to see if he was contented too. Their eyes met
and then they went back to their thoughts and
dreams. There were snatches of talk, flung
out from Pegeen’s drifting thoughts. She
wondered why pink was the happiest color
and she wondered whether the black sheep in
a flock was proud or ashamed, and she thought
the father birds must teach the baby birds to
fly because it would give mother birds nervous
prostration to do it, and she guessed God
didn’t give you any credit for loving all his
works when you were very happy because it
was easy as rolling off a log, and she was quite
sure that people who lived in white houses
were happier than people who lived in gray
houses, and she was afraid Miss Moran would
think they’d spent too much money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s coming up to see things just as soon
as we get home. She promised she would.
Maybe she’ll be there when we get there.
We’re driving so slowly and I told her we’d
surely be home before six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why bless my soul, Peg, are we fixed for
visitors?” Archibald’s tone held consternation,
but Pegeen treated his doubt with scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything’s as clean as can be, and fresh
flowers and a fire laid, and I told her the key
would be under the loose brick, if anything
kept us and she got there first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occurred to the man that there would be
something extremely agreeable about finding
the Smiling Lady waiting in the shack when
evening brought him home. He was reconciled
to the leisureliness of Susy’s ambling
gait, but Pegeen insisted upon speed. She
was afraid that it wouldn’t be light enough
for everybody to see her hat and dress, unless
they hurried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they’d see it afterwards,” she
admitted, “but they’ll be watching and it
would be nice for them to talk about this evening—’n’
then I promised Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Susy was urged to do her best and the
sun was still shining on the Valley when the
returning adventurers turned into Pisgah’s
main street and encountered Jimmy Dawes,
still barefoot but painfully scoured and elegant
in a clean shirt and flaming red tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald stopped without orders and
Pegeen stood up in the buggy to give her
friend the full benefit of her glory. She even
raised the pink parasol to add to the scenic
effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, by Jingo, would you have thought
it!”. Jimmy’s amazement was most satisfactory.
“Ain’t she a peach?” he asked Archibald
with that awed bewilderment with which
the masculine always regards feminine metamorphoses.
“Why, Peg, you’re getting good-looking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got,” said Pegeen, with no undue elation
but with deep conviction. There had
been mirrors in Ranson and Kirby’s Emporium
and she had consulted them without prejudice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’m not going to wear these all
the time, but I’m not bad even in the dark
gingham ones,” she asserted tranquilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t get stuck on yourself, that’s
all,” counseled Jimmy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious, no. It’s only the clothes,” she
explained. “I’m not any different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Valley was provided with something to
talk about that evening. The fading sunlight
rallied and glowed upon the pink frock and
the roses, as Pegeen made her triumphal journey
along the white road. An astonishing
number of the Valley folk happened to be
leaning over front gates or sitting on front
stoops or standing in front doorways. Peggy
waved her pink parasol at all and to those who
came down to the gates, she called gay greetings
and snatches of information about the
wonderful happenings of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it wasn’t so late, we’d stop and tell them
all about everything,” she said to Archibald.
“It seems almost mean not to. They’d enjoy
it so much, but anyway they’ve seen this dress
and my hat and parasol, and that’s a lot.
Ginsy Shalloway could talk about that much
for weeks ’n’ weeks. Maybe it’s nicer for
them to have things spread out and not know
about the other clothes and dinner at the hotel
and the floorwalker and Miss Carter and
everything all at once. I’m going to tell Miss
Moran every single thing, though. I feel as
if I’d have to tell it all to somebody this very
night or I’d explode, and she’s the nicest person
possible to tell things to. She always understands
exactly how everything was and how
you felt and what you thought. You don’t
have to explain a bit—just tell her things as
fast as ever you can ’n’ she keeps up. Don’t
you think the nicest people in the world are
the people you don’t have to explain to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know but what you are right,”—Archibald
thought it over. “Yes; I’m sure
you’re right, Peg. It’s a great thing to have
any one understand when you do explain; and
if somebody understands without having to
explain—yes; you’re undoubtedly right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Miss Moran’s like that. You tell
her a word or two and she knows the rest.
That’s why she gets on with all kinds of people
the way she does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal was at the gate when Susy
stopped before it, and Mr. Neal, thin, leathery,
solemn mannered but twinkling eyed,
rose from a chair on the porch and strolled
out to take the horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Land’s sakes, Peg, you’re a treat!”—Mrs.
Neal’s fat face was radiant with delight.
“Talk about fine feathers! Why, that’s as
tasty a hat as I ever saw, and as sweet a face
under it, I don’t care where the next comes
from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen opened her parasol and turned
round and round excitedly before her admirer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’N’ there’s more in boxes,” she announced.
“Heaps—’n’ there was strawberry ice cream
’n’ finger bowls ’n’—We’ve got to go, Miss
Moran’ll be there, but just as soon as I get
my breakfast dishes washed I’ll run down ’n’
tell you all about everything. Oh, Mrs. Neal,
it was perfectly grand. It was better ’n the
measles—only, of course I love Miss Moran
best. Anyway I love her just as well. Seems
as if I could love anybody though, when I’ve
got this hat and dress ’n’ parasol. I’m sorry
I ever said Benny Crocker was a nasty little
toad. He isn’t really, ’n’ anyway toads are
kind of cunning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess all the unloving things you ever
said wouldn’t make much of a spot on your
pink outfit,”—Mrs. Neal chuckled reassuringly—“and,
if you ask me, it’s the toad you
wasn’t fair to when you compared that
Crocker imp to it. I’m partial to toads myself.
They’re my best help in the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night.” Pegeen stretched two thin
arms up, slipped them round the neck of the
woman who stooped to her, and kissed the
broad expanse of cheek. “Maybe you don’t
like kissing,” she said apologetically, “but I
couldn’t help it. I hope I won’t meet anybody
I oughtn’t to kiss to-night, ’cause, like
as not, I’d up and do it anyway. Good
night, Mr. Neal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave Susy a love pat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t ever be a plain farmhorse any
more, Susy,” she said. “You’ve been part of
an adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like’s not she’ll be too upity to plow at
all,” drawled Mr. Neal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll plow lots better,”—Pegeen was
sure of it “She’ll have something to remember
and something to look forward to—’cause
anything that’s happened once could happen
again. Things like plowing and washing
dishes are fun if something has happened and
something’s going to happen. Good night,
everybody. I s’pose I don’t really need my
parasol open but I do love to carry it that
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Archibald went away up the
meadow path, arms full of packages, hearts
full of content. It had been a good day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal listened to the happy, excited
voice of the small girl as it floated back to her
on the still evening air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Pa,” she said, with smiling satisfaction,
“looks as if that child’s guardian angel’d
sat up at last and took notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were lights in the shack. Archibald
and Peggy saw them as soon as they turned
into the meadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s there!” the child cried happily. “I
knew she’d wait. She’s splendid about
promises. My, isn’t it good to come home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Archibald’s astonishment, it <span class='it'>was</span> good
to come home. He could not remember ever
having had the feeling before. Involuntarily
he quickened his steps. The end of a happy
day and some one waiting, and the lights of
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen ran on ahead, with a shrill shout of
greeting, and suddenly a girl’s figure stood in
the doorway, silhouetted grayly ’twixt twilight
and lamplight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome, wanderers!” cried a gay voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen was caught in strong, young arms,
hugged, kissed, questioned, all in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it perfect, Peggy? Not a cloud?
Such a duck of a frock, dear! And the hat!
<span class='it'>Oh, sweet!</span> The very hat of hats for you.
Darling wee roses and a heavenly pink, and
so becoming! Peg, I must hug you again. I
really must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen returned the embrace fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t anything like hugging when
you feel all bouncy inside,” she said. “I most
did it to Susy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been overlooked,”—Archibald’s voice
was mournful, and the child, all contrition,
flew at him and turned a glowing flower face
up for his kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to, something <span class='it'>awful</span>,” she acknowledged
shamelessly, “but I didn’t dare.”
Then she kissed Ellen rapturously, while a
young woman in an enveloping bib apron
ducked a respectful courtesy to Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen and I hope we’ll suit, sir,” she said
demurely. “Miss Pegeen O’Neill’s our riference.
I’m sure she’d be sayin’ a good
wur’rd for us, the way that you’d not be worryin’
over our bein’ alone with your spoons,—though
it’s few spoons we’ve found, to be
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brogue was rich as cream. The eyes
were a bit confusing, the dimples bereft the
man of speech, and the apron—was ever a
feminine garment so bewitching as an apron!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been getting supper for us?”
Archibald stammered at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have that—” She was all sweet apology.
“Ellen and I’ve been taking liberties.
It was Peggy’s big day, you know. We
couldn’t let her come home and do her work
as though it were an ordinary evening, so we
put up a basket of supper—and we’ve cooked
some biscuits in your oven—and you’ll forgive
us, won’t you? Sure, you’ve had a
whole day of playing Fairy Godfather.
You couldn’t grudge us our wee bit offering
at the quiet end of the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing he could have grudged
her when she looked at him like that. ’Twas
not in the heart of man to deal grudgingly
with the Smiling Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, miss, the biscuits will be
overdone,” warned Ellen, and, a moment
later, Archibald was looking across the table
into a face bewilderingly sweet, while Pegeen,
still wearing her beloved hat, though
she had reluctantly furled the pink parasol,
sat between her two best beloveds and beamed
impartially, first on one and then on the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s say grace,” she urged. “It’s the
graciest supper I ever had ’n’ it seems as if we
ought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald looked aghast; but the Smiling
Lady took the suggestion as a good one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear God,” she said,—and she spoke casually,
as friend to very present friend—“make
us all very happy and very loving and very
grateful on big days and little days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Specially little days, ’cause we can do it
ourselves on big days,” amended Pegeen, as
she reached for a biscuit.</p>

<h1 id='t2989'>V</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal saved Pegeen the trouble
of keeping her promise to run down
and tell her all about the day in Pittsfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breakfast dishes were washed at the
shack, but Pegeen was busily tidying the living-room,
and Archibald was only half-way
through his after-breakfast smoke when the
bulky form of their neighbor appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My soul,” she commented cheerfully.
“You folks don’t keep country hours, do you?
Pa and I had breakfast pretty nigh three
hours ago. I might ’a’ known you’d be backwards
if I’d stopped to think; but, you see,
I’d got through all my chores and it seemed
as if the heft of the morning was over, so I
just ran along up to see Peg’s new clothes. I
allowed the pile was too big for her to bring
down to me. I’m some big myself but I c’n
navigate handier than a lot of boxes and
bundles can. You said you was coming down
this morning to tell me all about everything,
Peg, but I thought I could see and hear at the
same time. Don’t want to bother you, though.
Maybe I’d rather come up later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald uttered a prompt protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not bothering anybody, Mrs. Neal.
We’re lazy but hospitable. At least I’m
lazy. Peggy’s not; but she’s an indulgent
person, so she doesn’t insist on ramping
around very early in the mornings. It isn’t
as if I were farming, you know. I can get at
my painting any time I feel like it, and when
I don’t feel like it I don’t do good painting;
so there you are! No merit in my getting up
with the early bird; my own special worm
wouldn’t be out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal settled into the chair he had
pushed forward to her and chuckled comfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sort of a lazy man’s job, ain’t it?” she said;
“but it takes all sorts of work to keep the world
moving and everybody happy. I guess
there’s folks in the cities that like your kind of
pictures. They look sort of daubed up and
queer to me, though. Sitting over here, that
one on the painting stand by the window don’t
look like anything at all but a mess of greens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen turned indignant eyes upon the art
critic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Mrs. Neal! That’s a piece of the
woods above Baker’s Spring, ’n’ it’s perfectly
lovely. I can most smell the woodsy things
growing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smell nothing!—without its turpentine!”
Mrs. Neal was genial but firm in her opinion.
“You ain’t got a call to be mad, Peg. Mr.
Archibald don’t care. Didn’t I say there was
folks that’d like his kind of pictures? I ain’t
educated. That’s what’s the matter with me,
and I know it, but there’s no use pretending
I don’t like my pictures plain and clear and
neat. You ain’t so awful educated either, but
you’re different. You’ve got imagination to
look with. I’ve only got far-sighted specs—and
that young eye doctor over at Pittsfield
made a bad guess on them too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire away, Mrs. Neal,” laughed the
painter. “I’ve known other people who
didn’t like my pictures. Some day I’ll paint
you a nice, clear, tidy one of your house and
garden. I really can, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitor’s broad face beamed delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, will you? That’d be fine. Pa and
I’d be tickled most to death—when the flowers
along the front walk get going real good,
you know—and maybe Pa and me on the front
porch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything you say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re real kind. I guess Peg’s had
you sized up right along, but it don’t take
much to be nice to Peg. When it comes to
being nice to a fat old party like me, you’re
proving something. Say, were you figuring
to go off painting somewheres this mornin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald blinked, looked at her thoughtfully,
and grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can,” he said amiably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t you do it, unless you were going
anyway, but you most always do and so they
thought it’d be all right and wouldn’t bother
you and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they?” Archibald asked comprehendingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’re sort of waiting around down
at my house. I was to wave a towel or something
if you were gone. We didn’t any of us
realize about you not getting up early, and
everybody was crazy to see Peg’s dresses and
things. Ginsy Shalloway’s curiosity was boiling
so hard when I left that it most moved her
false front up and down like a kettle cover.
She took a mornin’ off from Mrs. Frisbie so as
to come down here, but it don’t make much
difference, for Mrs. Frisbie was coming anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save the false front, Mrs. Neal,” Archibald
urged. “I’ll take myself out of the way
and Peggy will lend you a towel to wave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Neal smiled at him in friendly fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d all like first rate to meet you some
other time,” she said, “but, seein’ it’s about
clothes and all, I guess things ’ud be freer and
easier without you this mornin’. My apron’ll
do to wave, Peg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Archibald climbed the wood trail behind
the shack, he looked through an opening
in the leafiness and counted eight feminine
figures filing out of the Neals’ side gate and
taking the meadow path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, as he stood holding the
branches aside, but there was a pleasant
warmth at his heart. Neighbors of his!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still feeling neighborly when an
hour or two later he wandered down the western
slope of Pine Knob and found himself
confronted by the bars beyond which a
crooked lane led through the land of the Smiling
Lady to the white farmhouse under the
maples. He glanced at the sun, then looked
at his watch. Eleven o’clock. Time enough
for an hour’s neighboring and a stroll around
by the road to his one o’clock dinner. Morning
calls were informal but they seemed to be
the accepted thing in the Happy Valley, and
the Smiling Lady would send him away quite
frankly and amiably if he was in the way.
He felt sure of that. She would never allow
a man to make a nuisance of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found her in the vegetable garden and
she waved a trowel at him in a fashion that left
no doubt as to his welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven Sent One!” she hailed, coming
toward the fence to meet him. “I prayed for
a man—an able-bodied, obliging man, and behold!
I had set my heart on a morning’s
gardening and John had to take the horse
to the blacksmith. It was absolutely necessary.
He explained it all to me very clearly.
As a matter of fact, John hates gardening
as the devil hates holy water. He’ll commit
any of the venial sins to escape it. I
telephoned for Bill Briggs but he’s been away
for two days, so even if I could put a hand
on him he wouldn’t be garden-worthy. The
last time he pulled up all my young spinach
and transplanted a lot of very superior
plantain into the lettuce bed—but he gave me
a day’s work for nothing afterward. Bill’s
‘overtaken’ sometimes. He admits it, but he’s
a gentleman. Can you dig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind had ruffled her hair into wild disorder.
The hand that held the trowel was
grubby. The other hand was grubbier.
There was a broad streak of dirt across one
cheek and a smudge on her forehead. Her
short blue denim skirt was caked with earth at
the knees. A shockingly untidy young
woman, but, as she stood in the sunlight, laughing,
Archibald could have shouted for joy in
the free glad life of her. It was good just to
be in the world with anything so young and
brave and gay—and so lovely. Yes; even
when wind and gardening had done their
worst, so very lovely. Where was the man
who could refuse to dig for her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lead me to a spade,” he urged valiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hours later, Ellen coming out in the
garden to announce dinner, found two dirty,
tired, but cheerful beings scrambling across
freshly pulverized earth on all fours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The saints preserve us!” she exclaimed
piously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will, Ellen. That’s their job! But
I’m putting in beets and Mr. Archibald’s
planting beans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady sat back on her heels,
pushed back her hair with a grimy hand, and
looked up into the disapproving face of the
scandalized personage in spotless blue chambray
and white apron and cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t think what a success Mr. Archibald’s
been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man at the other end of the garden
looked up and grinned his gratitude for the
testimonial, then went back to his absorbing
task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s wasted on painting, Ellen,” the girl
went on gaily. “When you bring artistic
genius to bear on a vegetable garden, you’re
getting somewhere; but pictures—Pouff!
Who eats pictures? He’s strong, too—and
willing—and very industrious. I don’t see
but what our gardening problem is solved for
this summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you could be seein’ yourself, Miss
Nora!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen’s voice was dripping with disapproval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t. That’s the beauty of it.
And when I go up to make myself tidy, I
sha’n’t look in the mirror until after I’ve
washed—so I’ll never know the worst—and
gardening’s no fun at all if one keeps clean.
Look at Mr. Archibald. He was perfectly
clean when he came—painfully clean. Isn’t
he splendid now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald had finished his row and came
toward them, sleeves rolled up, collar a limp
rag, coatless, perspiring, dirt incrusted, radiating
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t a bean a twentieth of an inch
out of plumb in that row,” he boasted.
“Straight as a string, the whole procession.
It’ll be a garden ornament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny thing, I never planted a seed before
in my life. I can’t believe the things’ll come
up—and I’m likely to perish of joy and pride
if they do. You’ll have to break the news to
me gently, Miss Moran. There’s something
about getting down to the soil—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen thinks we’ve got down to too much
soil,” explained the girl who had risen to her
feet and was futilely brushing at her skirt.
“She has an old-fashioned prejudice in favor
of cleanliness and I suppose we’ll have to humor
her by washing before dinner. Stiff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you will be,” she promised encouragingly.
“I always am, at first. Gardening
is queer. Every time I finish a day of it, I
vow that the game isn’t worth the candle and
that I’ll eat tinned stuff and use wild flowers
for the rest of my life. Then the next morning,
I fairly wriggle with impatience to get
out into the garden and go to digging again.
It’s as bad as the cocaine habit. If you aren’t
willing to be a slave to it, you’d better turn
your back on it here and now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late. I’m a victim—and you’ll have
to oversee my digging. It’s the least you can
do when you’ve started me on my downward
way. Don’t you think so, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go your ways in and make yourselves decent,
the two of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen’s voice was stern but her eyes were
merry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve made a tremendous hit with her,”
the Smiling Lady confided to him as they went
through the hall. “She’s never nice and disrespectful
to anybody unless she likes him
enormously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stayed to dinner, after a faint-hearted
protest and a murmur of contrition in regard
to Pegeen’s wasted culinary efforts. He
voiced the latter to Ellen when, coming downstairs
before his hostess, he met the woman in
the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be worryin’ about Peg, sir,” she said
reassuringly. “She’s used to irregular doin’s
and she’ll just give you your dinner for supper—the
way that there’ll be nothin’ to do but
warm things up and set them on. It’d be a
shame—you to be goin’ and dinner ready
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked toward the stairway and added,
in a low voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s I that’ll be glad to see Miss Nora
sittin’ down with one of her own kind—and
her what she is, and everybody crazy about her
before, and all the fine clothes and visitin’ and
travelin’ and all—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s very happy, here, isn’t she?” the
man asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s happy. It’s her that has the
trick of happiness, but she’s the lonely days
and thinkin’ long’s the weary work. There’s
good people here, but none of them talk her
own talk, sir. It’d be well enough for a bit
in the summer, but winter and summer, in and
out—it don’t seem right. If you could have
seen how it was in the old days, sir—and now
only that daft John and me to do for her, and
she so cheerful and never a word of regret or
wishin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was sorrow and pride and great love
in the plain old Irish face, and Archibald
realized that he was being honored. Ellen
was not the woman to talk of her mistress to
any chance comer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a step in the upper hall, and the
servant vanished into the dining-room, while
Archibald went forward to meet a vision in
white linen, smooth-haired, immaculate,
laughing-eyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soap and water couldn’t revive my collar,”
he said apologetically, “but my hands and face
are approximately clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very, <span class='it'>very</span> beautiful,” said the
Smiling Lady. “What’s a collar, between
gardeners!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came around to the matter of neighboring
again, while they sat at dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as new to me as gardening,” he confessed,—“this
getting interested in the people
who live round about me and having them
take an interest—approving or otherwise—in
me. I can’t quite make up my mind whether
I like it or not. Just at the first jump, I’d
say I didn’t. Theoretically it’s a nuisance.
Down in New York, I didn’t care a hoot
whether the chap in the bachelor quarters
across the hall from mine lived or died or
drank himself into d-t’s or gave temperance
lectures or wore tweeds or pink velvet tights,
and I’d have resented his being curious about
me. But up here—well, everything’s different.
I fairly lap up Peg’s flow of information
about the Valley folk and I’m absorbingly
interested in the amount of Mrs. Frisbie’s
egg money, and in Bill Briggs’ habits and
in Ezra Watts’ bad reputation. I’m thirsting
to meet Ginsy Shalloway, and I’m Mrs.
Neal’s humble admirer. What’s more, I’ve
an amazing desire to make myself solid with
them all. Queer, isn’t it? I suppose it’s
mostly Pegeen—Pegeen and you. You two
make a fascinating sort of talisman of human
sympathy. Along came gray days and stupid
people. You rub your magic ring—and the
world’s an interesting place, and living in it
is glorious business. Makes a chap feel like
humping himself and going shopping for
magic rings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nora Moran dimpled at him approvingly
across the bowl of June roses that stood in the
center of the table. Spicy pink and white,
old-fashioned garden roses they were. It occurred
to Archibald that they rimed with the
face beyond them as no hot-house flowers could
have rimed with it. For one foolish, inconsequent
moment he tried to imagine himself
buying orchids for this garden girl. He had
bought many orchids. Women liked them
because they were so expensive, but for the
Smiling Lady—</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came back from the Fifth Avenue
flower shops to the June roses and the girl beyond
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re coming on rapidly,” she was saying.
“It isn’t every one who could discover,
neighboring and gardening all in one short
June. Some people never discover either of
them—poor souls. That’s why the yellow
journals have scandals enough and tragedies
enough to keep them going. But if you’ve
got it in you to garden—and to neighbor—Oh,
I’ve great hopes of you. Peggy will
make something of you yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there aren’t any scandals and tragedies
in the country?” he asked lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow crept into the girl’s smiling eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there are—dreadful ones sometimes—and
they seem even more dreadful up here
than they do in town because each one stands
out so stark and ugly against the beauty all
round about it. I had frightfully heartachey
times when I first began to find the sordid,
ugly things growing along with the loveliness
in this quiet country place—jealousies and
feuds and slovenliness and vulgarity and
cruelty and worse—but I worked my way
through those heartaches—or at least I learned
to understand and be tolerant The weeds
grow with the flowers everywhere, I guess.
And it’s so easy to think too much about your
neighbors’ business when you haven’t anything
else to entertain you, and to magnify
little slights and offenses when you haven’t
more important things to occupy your mind.
And it’s hard to live up to standards when
there’s no one to appreciate—and natural
beauty doesn’t give you much joy, if you’ve
always been doing hard, grinding work in the
midst of it. Gracious! I only wonder that
most of the country folk are such plumb dears
as they are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they garden and neighbor,” prompted
Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t.” She was too much in earnest
to be polite. “You don’t think raising
vegetables and knowing everybody for miles
around are gardening and neighboring, do
you? Not a bit of it. You’ve got to put your
heart into the garden and the people if you’re
going to do real gardening and neighboring.
When you get around to that, you’ve learned
how to be happy most of the time and contented
all of the time. I used to think that
nine tenths of the people I met were uninteresting,
but I’ve found out that, all the time,
there weren’t any uninteresting people.
There were only people I hadn’t <span class='it'>got
at</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald shook his head doubtfully.
“Short of using a pickax or an auger—” he demurred.
He was thinking of some of the
men and women he had known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t they <span class='it'>awful</span>—that kind? But there
are more of them in town than in the country.
There really are—more in proportion to numbers,
I mean. I don’t mean for a minute that
I’ve got at everybody up here in the Valley
but, accidentally or by mainforce, I’ve broken
through some such hard shells and with such
surprising results that I’m beginning to have
a comfortable conviction about what’s inside
of the very toughest human crust, if one could
only get through to it. Now there’s Ezra
Watts. He lives just a little way from here
up the back road—much too near for the welfare
of my chickens and fruit and vegetables.
I’ve an idea he even milks my cows. He’s
one of my failures and nobody in the Valley
doubts that he’s bad all the way through. I
have awful misgivings myself sometimes, but
in my optimistic moments I still contend that
there’s a decent scrap of soul hidden away
somewhere in Ezra—hidden so thoroughly
that even he doesn’t suspect it’s there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel strangely drawn to Ezra,” Archibald
murmured gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady flashed back a challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you take him on?” she asked.
“I’ve fumbled the thing. Maybe what he
needs is man talk. It’s a long chance, but
there’s really something very sporty about
soul hunting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a mirthful ring even to her sentiment.
She talked of souls as she might have
talked of kittens or puppies or marigolds.
From that angle, talk of souls did not seem the
indelicate or embarrassing thing it is taken
for by the average person not professionally
concerned with soul culture or soul saving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m willing to warn you, though,” she conceded
generously, “that Ezra needs disinfecting
as much as he needs moral suasion. Nobody
will ever burrow through to his soul until
he’s had a bath.”</p>

<h1 id='t3530'>VI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the afternoon when Archibald
turned up at the shack, and Pegeen, arrayed
in one of the cheapest of the new frocks
and very dressy as to hair ribbons and shoes,
came down the path to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a shame for them to scare you off so
you didn’t even come home to dinner,” she
said indignantly, “but you needn’t have been
afraid. I shooed them all away at half-past
eleven; they had to go home and get their own
dinners anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t afraid of my neighbors. I was
gardening for one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she looked puzzled. Then
she knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Moran! Well, if she isn’t the greatest!
She could make anybody garden; was it
flowers or vegetables?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad,” said Peg, regretfully. “Of
course it’s all nice and exciting and like helping
God with his chores, but flowers seem
best. They’re so perfectly lovely when they
come up and blossom—but then, I love string
beans, don’t you? Only they’re just green
and I think it’s more fun to help make something
bright colored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever have a garden of your own?”
Archibald asked. They had reached the
shack now and he dropped down on the doorstep
and filled his pipe. Pegeen sat down beside
him, after carefully turning up the abbreviated
skirt of her new dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use dirtying it any faster than I have
to,” she explained. “Every washing takes it
out of them even when they aren’t pink. No,
I never had a garden—what you’d call a real
garden. We never had much garden. Sometimes
Dad would put in corn or potatoes but
mostly he forgot, and if he didn’t forget them,
he did after he’d put them in, and I didn’t
have much time to take care of them. I had
some poppies once though, perfectly wonderful
poppies. Miss Moran gave me the seeds.
I hadn’t ever planted any flower seeds at all
till one day I was down at her house and she
was working in the flower garden and let me
help. I sowed some seed of those great big
blue larkspur—delphiniums she calls them,
but I think larkspur’s nicest, don’t you?—and
some poppies too. Poppies have got the cunningest
baby seeds that you don’t dare cover up
warm at all for fear you’ll choke them to
death. She let me take some poppy seed
home, and I dug a place right outside
Mother’s window. She was sick then, you
know, and after the poppies blossomed, I used
to get Mother up every single day to see them.
They were the gladdest, brightest, danciest
things, but they used to make Mother sort of
sad sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat quiet for a few moments, looking
out with wistful eyes toward the far hills, and
Archibald laid a large hand over the two small
ones clasped in her lap. The sober little face
flashed a quick response. Happiness was always
knocking at the door of Pegeen’s heart
even when sorrow housed there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poppies down at Miss Moran’s were
nice too,” she went on, “but I was awfully disappointed
about my larkspur. It didn’t
bloom a bit that summer, and Miss Moran had
said it would be blue, and I like blue best of
anything, don’t you? It isn’t so bright as
red, but it’s such a way-deep-down-glad color.
Well, that fall, Miss Moran had me move the
larkspur plants over by the lily bed; and one
day the next summer, when I hadn’t been up
there for weeks, John came after me with the
horse and said Miss Moran wanted me in a
hurry. I was afraid she was sick, but she
wasn’t She just grabbed me when I got
there and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Peggy O’Neill, you’ve been working
miracles. Come along quick and see them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we held hands and raced to the garden
and there were my larkspurs all blossoming—a
great big patch of them with white lilies
cuddling up close to them! Blue? Why,
you never saw anything bluer. I looked at
them and my legs went wobbly and I flopped
right down and cried. Yes, sir, honestly I
did. I couldn’t stand having helped God
make anything so beautiful. He was used to
it but I wasn’t. Isn’t it wonderful that He
could think of so many perfectly splendid
things to make in seven days? There’s no
telling what He’d have done, if He’d taken a
year to do it. Did you ever try to think of
something more that would have been awfully
nice and that He could have done if He’d
taken more time? I’ve tried lots of times, but
I never could. It seems as if He hadn’t forgotten
a thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never felt the same about myself since
I helped Him with those larkspurs. They
bloom every summer, and every time I see
them, I feel as if I’d made a piece of sky. You
get Miss Moran to let you plant some larkspur
in her garden. You won’t ever feel real
downhearted and discouraged about yourself
afterward. I do think a flower garden’s the
sweetest thing. I wish we had one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t we have one?” asked Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen looked at him doubtfully, saw determination
in his face, and fairly crowed for
joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out in front and along the path! Poppies
and bachelor buttons and marigolds and
lots of things that’ll bloom quick—and then
larkspur and phlox and lilies to bloom next
summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her exultant voice suddenly wavered and
dropped, and the joy died out of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the man did not understand.
Then he looked ahead and saw the end of the
summer’s trail. Oddly enough he too shrank
from the vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming back, Peg,” he promised
quickly. “I’m surely coming back. The
heart of the world is up here among the hills,
I believe, and there’s nothing to keep me
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled again then—but a misty little
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just thought—all of a sudden—” she explained
falteringly. “A summer’s so short
and I’m being so happy—and it’s half-past
June already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why we must hurry with our garden.”
There was a sympathetic mist in the
man’s own eyes, but he resolutely dragged the
talk away from sentiment. It’s a way men
have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll plant all sorts of splendid things and
the Smiling Lady will teach us to work
miracles,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll give us loads of baby plants. She
loves starting new gardens.” Pegeen was
cheerful again now. He had said he would
come back and it was easy for her to believe
in happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow I’ll dig the beds,” promised
Archibald. “Now tell me what the neighbors
thought of your new finery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen was all excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They couldn’t believe it. They honestly
couldn’t. Ginsy Shalloway’ll talk herself to
death about them, and Mrs. Frisbie said that
either you were cracked or just a natural
spendthrift, and Mrs. Neal spoke right up and
said you were a big-hearted young gentleman,
that’s what you were; and I hugged her for it
and they’re all crazy to know what you get
paid for your pictures, and I said maybe you’d
let me take you to see them only maybe not,
because you had lots of painting to do and
couldn’t let visiting interfere. So you don’t
have to go if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do want to, Peg. I’m going to garden
and to neighbor. I’m credibly informed
that there’s the road to being happy most of
the time and contented all the time. I’m going
to send to town for a horse of mine that’s
eating his head off in the stables, and we’ll
rent a cart, and then we can neighbor fast and
furiously all up and down the Valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my stars!” crooned Pegeen, in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you ride your horse?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what he’s for, chiefly. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I just thought maybe you’d lend him
to Miss Moran when you weren’t neighboring.
She loves riding better than anything
and she had a beautiful riding horse when she
came, but he hurt himself jumping the pasture
fence and died, and she couldn’t afford
to get another. She’s the loveliest thing on
horseback—but, do you know, she rides
straddle just like a boy and she wears breeches
and sometimes they show; folks here thought
it was awful at first. They buzzed around to
each other’s houses like a swarm of bees, talking
about it, and they thought maybe Mr.
Colby, the minister, ought to take it up. And
he wouldn’t. He said she didn’t go to his
church, and that anyway it wasn’t a thing for
a single man to take up with a young lady.
So then they thought the ladies’ aid would
have to do something, but they sort of put it
off, and then Mr. Frisbie went to Boston to
spend a week with his rich brother that’s a
minister in a big church there. He came back
telling that the parks up there were simply full
of ladies riding straddle and that his brother’s
wife said all the richest and properest ladies
wore breeches when they rode and that it was
countrified to be shocked. So then everybody
quieted down. Mrs. Neal says Ginsy Shalloway
sent for a pattern for riding breeches,
but I don’t believe she’s ever had a call for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald, who had been chuckling over
the Valley’s consternation, had an inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy,” he said, “I wonder if Mrs. Neal
could stable two horses for me. You and I
are going to do our neighboring behind a pair—but
remember, Peg, I never heard that the
Smiling Lady rode. That extra riding horse
is going to be a lucky accident. Incidentally,
I’m going to teach you to ride him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my stars!” The small girl crooned it
again, from heart fullness. “And I didn’t
even pray for you to come! If I could have
thought of anything as nice as you, I’d have
prayed for it, but I couldn’t. So I just said
‘God bless me’ and I guess He thought that
meant sending you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, Peg,” Archibald said very
softly. He couldn’t remember having asked
God to bless any one, since far away bedtimes
in which a very small boy and a very loving
mother and a certain little white bed in a
cheerful nursery figured hazily. Come to
think of it, he hadn’t been on speaking terms
with God at all, since those old days; but here
in the Happy Valley one met Him at every
turn and He seemed very friendly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dinner missed at noon was, according
to Nora’s prophecy, warmed up for supper;
and after it was eaten and the dishes had been
washed Archibald walked down to Mrs. Benderby’s
with Pegeen, because she was later
than usual and the shadows were black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the two passed out of the meadow, they
found Mr. and Mrs. Neal standing in the
middle of the road in front of their home, talking
excitedly and looking down toward Pisgah,
where a red glow lighted the sky from
behind a crouching black hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” Archibald asked. “Oh, I
see—fire. What do you think it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another barn, I guess,” Mr. Neal said
grimly. “From the looks, I should say ’twas
Frisbie’s. Getting past a joke, this thing is.
Makes a man feel darned uncomfortable when
he goes to bed. Something’s got to be done.
That’s the fifth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifth what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifth barn burning! Set on fire every one
of ’em. Nobody suspected at first, but the
fires began coming along too regular to be accidental
and then there were signs of the work
found, but they ain’t been able to catch the
fire-bug. He don’t seem to steal anything—crazy,
most likely. Just likes to watch the
things burn, but there’s been a big loss and one
house went too, and folks are mighty stirred
up about it. I don’t feel none too easy myself.
There’s no telling where the thing’ll
hit next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had detectives on the job, I suppose?” said
Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, the town got a couple of ’em up
here. Ate everything within sight and looked
wise and got nowheres. They sort of suspected
Ezra Watts, but, jumping Jerusha,
everybody else had thought of that before they
did. That’s the first rule up here when anything
goes wrong. Suspect Ezra. He’s a
good deal of a pill, Ezra is, and I don’t put
much past him in the way of meanness, but I
can’t say as I held him accountable for the
drought last year or for my horses having pink
eye this spring. I’ve got a leaning toward
proof, and there ain’t a ghost of proof against
Ezra in this barn business—except just his
general cussedness and that he thinks he’s got
a grudge against the Valley folks—but I’m
kind of afraid some of the young fellows’ll
handle him rough, without asking for proof,
if this barn burning keeps up. When Nick
Bullard and Lem Tollerton and that crowd
get a drink or two aboard, they don’t set much
store by law and order. I kind of figure that
this would be a healthy time for Ezra to visit
somewheres without waiting to be invited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean that they’d really harm
him?” Archibald said incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as I said, there’s just a few of the
boys that ain’t strong on law and order, when
they’re full of liquor ’n’ animal spirits ’n’ have
what they’d call a good cause. Of course the
rest of us would stop them if we got wind of
their deviltry in time, but we generally don’t
and then when it’s over there’s nobody wants
to run them down and jail them because everybody
knows their families and neighbors are
with them. Last time they made trouble they
beat up a peddler that had been cheating all
the women. Can’t say he didn’t deserve a
licking, but the boys overdid it and got considerable
of a scare themselves. Thought
they’d killed the fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma and I took him in and nursed him up
and turned him out all right. He did talk
some about suing for assault and all that, but,
shucks, how’d he know who to sue? The
boys wore masks. He was some scared too,
and so he went off as soon as he was able—and
glad to go. Glad to have him go, we were.
You’ve got to do you’re duty, but I must say
I ain’t strong on Samaritaning when the hurt
party’s as low down a skunk as that peddler
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boys ain’t been taking any law into
their hands since that, but the whole neighborhood’s
so stirred up over this fire-bug—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop borrowing trouble, Pa,” Mrs. Neal
interrupted. “Nice idea of his neighbors
you’ll be giving Mr. Archibald. You’re
getting as nervous as a tadpole over this barn
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too nervous to put up a pair of horses for
me, if I send for them?” inquired Archibald
laughingly, but Mr. Neal’s face was serious as
he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your own risk. I’ll be glad to take
them but you’d better insure them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald met Mrs. Benderby for the first
time that night. She was sitting on the porch
as he and Peg turned in at the gate, and, rising
from her chair, came forward to meet
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Mr. Archibald,” Pegeen announced
with an air of proud proprietorship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman gave him a thin cold hand.
The chill of it made him peer more closely at
her through the starlit gloom, but he could
see her face only in dim outlines. Scanty hair
brushed smoothly back from the forehead and
fastened in a tight knob at the back of the head
left hollow temples in view and below them
Archibald made out sunken cheeks and the angles
of a sharp chin. But it was the woman’s
figure that emphasized most clearly the chill
of the bony hand. Even in the starlight, the
sunken chest and rounded shoulders, the sagging
droop of the whole body told their tale
of hard work and physical unfitness and utter
weariness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to meet you,” Mrs. Benderby
was saying. “Peg’s told me how wonderful
good you’ve been to her and I think a sight
of Peg. I’d ought to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was weariness in the voice too, yet it
strove for a brisk cheerfulness that was evidently
its natural note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something tugged suddenly at Archibald’s
heartstrings. Life was too hard for women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; you and I couldn’t do without Pegeen,”
he said. The friendly warmth of his
voice affected the tired little woman as had
the warm strength of his hand-clasp. There
<span class='it'>was</span> something about Peg’s Mr. Archibald,
she admitted to herself—something that
cheered one up a bit. That “you and I” had
a folksy sort of ring. He wasn’t stuck up if
he did come from New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled in the dark and though he could
not see the smile he heard it in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you get used to having Peg around,
nothing goes right without her,” she said.
“Seems as if she always knew what you needed
or wanted before you did. She spoils people,
Peg does—gets ’em so they can’t live alone and
most of us has to live alone sooner or later—even
when there’s plenty of folks living in the
same house with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald nodded. He had lived alone
“with plenty of folks” and he knew what she
meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you sit down, sir?” Mrs. Benderby
asked. “We’ll go indoors if you say, but it’s
kind of cool and restful out here in the dark.
I like being in the dark, evenings. You can’t
see things you’d ought to get up and do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had dropped into her rocking chair
again and Archibald sat down on a broken-backed
bench, while Pegeen went into the
house. He could hear her bustling about in
the kitchen and humming a gay tune as she
worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t she the cheerfulest thing?” Mrs.
Benderby said, after a quiet moment in which
she too had been listening to the quick, light
steps and the rollicking tune. “Seems as if,
as soon as she’s around, I feel rested. You
just can’t slump down when Peg’s boosting
you. Even thinking about her’s better than
medicine. Some days when I ain’t my best
and the work don’t go good, I hang on to the
thought of Peg as if ’twas a patent life-preserver.
Funny, ain’t it—a little scrap of a
big-eyed thing like her! She ain’t exactly
pretty, Peg ain’t, but I think the angels must
be some like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder,” Archibald agreed.
He could understand why Pegeen had felt that
she must go over and see to Mrs. Benderby.
He felt strongly impelled to see to her himself—and
he smiled as it occurred to him that
perhaps he was really neighboring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must put your heart into the gardens
and the people,” the Smiling Lady had said.
Well, he seemed to be putting his heart into
Mrs. Benderby. Something ought to be done
about her, something even more than Pegeen
was doing. He didn’t like the remembrance
of that clammy hand or the ache of weariness
in the voice that held no trace of complaint
or bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and Peg and I will have to look after
each other a little,” he said later as he rose to
go. “Of course I know that Peg could see
to both of us competently with one hand tied
behind her, but you and I will get into the
game for our own sakes. I’m going to depend
upon you to advise me about the child.
Women understand such things better than
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be proud to help,” she said eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to him that the hand she gave him
in good night had a thrill of warmth in it and
that the bent shoulders had straightened just
a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Peg,” he called through the
open door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small girl came running out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just getting ready for morning,” she
explained. “Mrs. Benderby has to go off real
early, and any way I thought it’d be nice for
you and her to get acquainted without me
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was awfully good of you to bring me
home. I wasn’t afraid—not really—only
it’s so comfortable not to have to be not afraid.
Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he went through the gate, she called
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night I’ll be up to you early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald walked home with the friendly,
childish voice ringing in his ears and in his
heart an unaccountably fervent thankfulness
that she surely would be “up to him early.”
Morning—even a June morning—wouldn’t,
be a cheerful thing with Pegeen away.</p>

<h1 id='t4078'>VII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was a momentous one at the
shack. Archibald and Pegeen started
their garden and Wiggles was taken into the
family. The garden came along according to
plan but Wiggles was accidental. Peggy
brought him with her when she arrived in the
morning and the first intimation of his presence
came to Archibald with a request for an
antiseptic bandage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you had some in your trunk, and it’s
time for you to get up anyway,” Peggy called
through the bedroom door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hurt?” he asked in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m all right. It’s a dog. I guess
it was an automobile. Anyway its leg’s hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The explanation was hardly lucid but Archibald
gathered that first aid measures were being
taken for the dog not for the automobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute and I’ll help,” he said as
he passed a roll of bandage through the partly
opened door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’d only spoil your breakfast.” She was
serious but practical. “I can do it. I’ve
done it to lots of things. There’s peroxide
on the mantel and he’s as patient as can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Archibald, shaven and dressed, left
his room a half hour later, there were no signs
of casualty and Pegeen was as serene as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all fixed,” she said. “It wasn’t so
terribly bad, but he couldn’t walk and of
course I couldn’t leave him down there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” agreed Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after breakfast, as she led him out to
see the cripple, a shade of anxiety crossed her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He isn’t a handsome dog,” she warned—“not
exactly handsome, but he’ll be real cute
when I’ve washed him—and he won’t be a
bit of trouble to you. I’ll keep him in the
shed and I’ll—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Piffle, Peg!” interrupted the man rudely.
“We needed a dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dirty, shaggy little beast lying on a pile
of burlap in the shed was not handsome.
Pegeen had spoken within bounds. Mongrel
was written large on him, but a strain of Airedale,
albeit with a bar sinister across it, gave
his ugliness a redeeming dash of distinction,
and when two beseeching, friendly brown
eyes met Archibald’s and the whole dog from
sniffing nose to frantically wagging tail, wiggled
propitiation, the man took the new-comer
into the family with something like enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s <span class='it'>not</span> handsome, Peg,” he agreed, “but
he’s a jolly little chap. We’ll call him Wiggles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A day or two later, Archibald coming home
from a morning’s painting found Pegeen with
something on her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little it came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like kittens, Mr. Archibald?” she
asked with elaborate casualness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so-so.” He was absorbed in cleaning
his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s awful to drown them, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught the note of anxiety in her voice
and looked at her quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Moran does too,” she urged in defense
of her position. “Maybe she’d take it
if you don’t want me to have it, but I’d like
to doctor its eyes first. It’ll be lovely when
its eyes are well—and the boys had a piece of
fish line and a stone. They thought it was
fun. I flew right at Benny Crocker and
slapped him—as hard as ever I could—and he
was so surprised he dropped the kitten and
then I grabbed it up—and I always did want
to slap Benny anyway. If I’d been a boy I’d
have licked him long ago and I don’t see why
being a girl—only of course long hair’s handy
to pull—but they didn’t get a chance to-day.
I can run as fast as any boy, if I do have skirts.
It’s gray with one white paw. I think you’d
like it, if its eyes weren’t sore. I’m putting
boric acid in them. That’s what the doctor
gave Mrs. Neal for hers when they were red
and hurt her and she loaned me some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does Wiggles say about it?” Archibald
asked gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen giggled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t dare tell you,” she said. “He
swore. Honestly he did—dog swearing anyhow—but
when he found I liked the kitten,
he quieted down and now he just laughs when
the spunky little thing spits at him. I do love
a dog that has a long nose so he can laugh, don’t
you? I wouldn’t have one of those snub-nosed,
sulky looking dogs for anything—unless
it was sick or something and needed to be
taken care of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Peg, Peg! Are we going to take care
of all the halt and maimed and blind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him thoughtfully. “Well,—they
aren’t all likely to come along our way
and anyway I won’t have any more here if you
hate it; but you see I always did—and I can’t
leave them alone at Mrs. Benderby’s all day
and so I—but of course we won’t have any
more here if it bothers you—just Wiggles and
Spunky. I thought we’d call kitten Spunky.
She’s so little and she stands up to Wiggles as
if she were his size. I sort of think that kitten’s
Irish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, child, I don’t mind running a
foundling asylum. Why should I? I’m one
of the foundlings and I’m as grateful to you
as Wiggles and Spunky ever can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him soberly for a moment and
then she smiled. There was something extra
special about Pegeen’s smile. A hint of it was
not always playing about her lips and eyes as
the elusive promise of smiles always lurked in
Nora Moran’s face. The child’s sensitive
mouth and great dark blue eyes were profoundly
serious much of the time—quietly
happy but serious for all that. When the
smiles came, they flashed out suddenly, radiantly,
a surprise, an illumination, a wave of
gaiety rippling from brow to chin and overflowing
the whole child. Even her hair ribbons
seemed to quiver with it, her short skirts
to swish with mirth, her slim little feet to move
to dance tunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To see it once was to want more of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Making you happy is sheer, wanton self-indulgence,
Peg,” Archibald said as he studied
her face. “I’ll not acquire merit by
anything I do to set you smiling. That’s
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not understand but that made no
difference. He often talked over her head,
but words were unimportant. The essential
thing was that he should be pleased with her
and he was. She could see that. Moreover,
he wasn’t prejudiced against stray kittens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I won’t show her to you until her eyes
are better,” she said wisely. “A smashed leg
like Wiggles’ is sort of interesting when it’s
all bandaged up, but you’ve got to love a thing
considerable much not to mind sore eyes. If
I ever get sick and stay sick a long time, I do
hope it’ll be a nice, clean, interesting kind of
sickness—but what I’d like best would be to
be sitting out in the sunshine feeling happy
and then just not to be there—like Mr. Benderby.
It was hard on Mrs. Benderby, but
wasn’t it perfectly lovely for him? Out under
the big apple tree he was, and it was all
in bloom and there were orioles nesting in it.
I think that was wonderful, don’t you? I’d
have liked that for Mother—only it was so
lovely for me to have a chance to take care of
her. I guess that’s why God doesn’t let
everybody go in beautiful ways. He knows
they’re going to be so happy in a little while
that having been sick won’t count and He lets
them go the hard way so that the people who
love them and are going to have to stay on
without them can have the comfort of taking
care of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s one way of looking at it,” said
Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were occupying their favorite seat on
the doorstep now. Pegeen’s elbows were on
her knees, her hands cupping her chin, her
eyes gazing out across the Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think souls look like, Mr.
Archibald?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald considered the subject and acknowledged
that he had no theories on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve thought about it lots,” Peg said
cheerfully. Her discussions of life, death,
and immortality were always imperturbably
cheerful. Nothing morbid touched her.
Life was a fact and death was a fact and immortality
was a fact. They were all vastly interesting.
Why not wonder about them and
talk about them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think most people have a horrid idea
about souls, don’t you?” she said. “Sort of
foggy, lonesome things that go floating around
trying to be happy when they haven’t got anything
to be happy with. Honestly, that kind
of souls would have just about as good a time
in heaven as Bill Briggs does at grange parties.
They don’t have liquor and he says he isn’t
built for conversation. I think heaven’s going
to be heaps cozier than the ministers say.
I’m counting on having legs and hands and
eyes and nose and everything, just the way I
have here, only no aches or freckles or anything,
and only beautiful things to feel and see
and smell—and stacks of little child angels to
see to, so that we won’t miss having the old
people and sick people to take care of. I’m
expecting to enjoy heaven and if I do it’ll
have to be mighty different from the way they
tell about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a job in heaven that would suit
you,” Archibald said, “but another angel has
it. Maybe he’d take you on to help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” she urged eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s in the Japanese heaven; but I
suppose we’ll all be talking the same language
when we get over there so that won’t shut you
out. There’s a Japanese angel—Jizo, they
call him,—and he puts in his whole time playing
with the souls of the little children that
come to heaven, so that they won’t be lonesome
for their mothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my stars!” The small girl was all
aglow. “What a bee-autiful job! Wouldn’t
it be cunning to see—all those blessed little
baby souls playing around and that big kind
angel making up games for them and seeing
to them for God? But one angel couldn’t
do it—not possibly. Maybe he could when
the world started and there weren’t many
children going to heaven, but now he’d have
to have somebody else. Oh, I do hope he’ll
let me help. That’s the most interesting thing
I ever heard about heaven. Mostly it sounds
stupid, but I always did think God would be
too sensible to let us all sit around and rest
forever. I wonder if that Jizo thought up
his job for himself and asked for it or if God
just gave it to him. Mr. Frisbie says the Japanese
are awfully smart but that they’re ruining
wages—only I don’t suppose they bother
about wages in heaven. I wouldn’t want
wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald rose and stretched himself,
laughing down at the earnest little face upturned
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m willing to bet your month’s wages here
that you’ll be given a chance to take care of
somebody in heaven,” he said. “They say the
seraphim are for adoration and the cherubim
are for service. Well, I can see you chumming
with the cherubs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen looked perturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Moran has pictures of them,” she
said doubtfully. “They aren’t anything but
heads and wings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the painters’ fault. They couldn’t
imagine anything as beautiful as a cherub so
they gave up before they got fairly started.”
The small girl on the doorstep nodded understanding
and relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need legs and hands if you’re going
to do much,” she said, “and if I don’t set mine
going you won’t have any supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wiggles and Spunky improved so rapidly
under expert treatment that bandages and
boric acid were speedily put aside and the two
new members of the household were promoted
from obscurity to family intimacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crow with an injured wing, and a squirrel
rescued at the eleventh hour from Wiggles,
and two fluffy yellow chickens whose
hysterical mother had tramped on them during
a panic over a temporary scarcity of
worms, were at various times added to the
family group, but the crow and the chickens
and the squirrel were merely transients.
Once repaired, they went back to the wild
life and Mrs. Neal’s chicken yard, though
Peterkin, the crow, came back occasionally to
sit on the birch tree by the kitchen door and
caw at Peg; and Jabberwok, the squirrel, had
a nest in a near-by oak from which he threw
acorns at Wiggles with unerring aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boots was a transient too, but he did not
need bandaging or doctoring and he stayed on
as a day boarder for a long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald almost stumbled over him one
day as he came through the woodshed after
an early morning fishing excursion with
Jimmy Dawes. He had brought Jimmy home
to breakfast and then came in the back way,
triumphantly waving creditable strings of
trout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gurgle of appreciation sounded at Archibald’s
feet and he stepped back, hastily looking
down into the round staring eyes of a fat
baby who sat comfortably strapped into a pine
box and held out chubby hands toward the
shining fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll be—” began the man. Then he
remembered Jimmy, and left the remark hanging
in the air unfinished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” commented Jimmy. “Going in
for baby farming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peg!” Archibald’s voice held alarm and
protest. It brought Pegeen out from the
kitchen, frying pan in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Jimmy! Going to stay for breakfast?
My, what a lot of fish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she saw the question in Archibald’s
face and her glance followed his to the
occupant of the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” she explained. “That’s Boots—Mrs.
McKenzie’s Boots. His mother’s
sick and there isn’t anybody except old
Granny McKenzie and she can’t possibly do
everything and take care of Boots too. I ran
over there this morning to see how sick Mrs.
McKenzie was and everything was a mess and
the poor old lady was most crazy. I’d have
stayed, only of course there’s you; so I helped
tidy things up and then I just brought Boots
along with me. I knew you’d want me to.
He won’t be a mite of trouble. I never saw
such a good baby. I can look after him here,
daytimes and take him home with me nights.
He’s so cunning. Look at him laugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped on her knees beside the box
and waggled her head at the baby, who discarded
his wide-eyed solemnity for a dimpling,
gurgling hilarity that would have disarmed
the most confirmed baby hater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’ you guess Jizo’d think of <span class='it'>him</span>?”
Peg asked enthusiastically. She was so happy
in her new responsibility, so utterly confident
of Archibald’s readiness to share it with her,
that the protest faded out of him. He stooped
and experimentally poked at the baby’s ribs
with a fishy forefinger which Boots promptly
grabbed, crowing in triumph as he held fast
to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something curious happened to the stooping
man. He wasn’t at all sure what it was but
knew that it had to do with the feeling of that
tiny hand curled round his finger. The hand
was so absurdly small and soft and clinging.
He had never noticed babies. People had
them, but they had always seemed to him one
of the necessary evils, mitigated in his own
class by the existence of vigilant nurses who
kept their charges out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wouldn’t have believed that there could
be something extraordinarily pleasant about
having a baby hang fast to one’s forefinger
and jump up and down with pride in the
feat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strong little beggar, isn’t he?” he said with
a shamefaced glance at Jimmy that bespoke
masculine sympathy for his embarrassment
But Jimmy was used to babies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly kid!” he said, swinging his string of
fish toward the baby who abandoned Archibald’s
finger to clutch at the slippery prize.
“I’ll fix the trout for you, Peg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald straightened up and looked at
the boy admiringly. Nothing disturbed
Jimmy’s cheerful nonchalance—but then
Jimmy had not a strange baby deposited, without
warning, in his family circle. He would
eat his breakfast and go home, but the baby,
apparently, was to stay at the shack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you call him, Peg?” the alleged
Head of the Family asked feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, his name’s Bruce,—after the spider
man, you know. The McKenzies are Scotch.
But they call him ‘Boots.’ Baby talk’s silly
but I do think Boots is a nice funny little
name, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went back to the kitchen with Jimmy,
and Archibald followed, with a backward
glance at the baby who resigned himself
philosophically to the desertion and settled
back among the pillows with the evident intention
of going to sleep at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good old Boots!” murmured the man to
whom philosophy had always come hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he washed his hands at the kitchen
pump, he eyed his forefinger with a whimsical
smile. Queer little thing, a baby’s hand. He
could imagine that if the baby happened to
be a man’s own—after all, perhaps even neighboring
wasn’t the last word. Human brotherhood
was a big thing, but a man’s own—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ you like them fried in corn meal, Mr.
Archibald?” called Pegeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said that he did.</p>

<h1 id='t4553'>VIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The horses came from town and, though
stabled by Mr. Neal, were in a way additional
members of the shack family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a man who fled to the country to be
alone, this is going some,” Archibald said to
himself, as for the first time he rode up the
meadow path, leading a second saddled horse.
Pegeen and Wiggles and Spunky and Boots
and Peterkin—who was not yet well enough
to respond to the call of the wild, were all on
hand to welcome the new animals, and Archibald’s
eyes twinkled as he viewed the collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is where you take your first riding
lesson, Peg. I’m going to put you on Zip,”
he said gaily. “Will the menagerie break
loose if you take your eye off it? Suppose the
baby should choke the pup and the pup should
bite the cat and the cat should eat the crow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be good,” promised Pegeen comfortably
as she loosened the baby’s strangle-hold
on the pup. “Aren’t those horses
splendid? I wonder how Susy feels about
them. It’s real hard on her, I think, having
them come into her own barn, putting on city
airs, and saying snippy things about farm
horses and farm ways.—I’ll bet they do.
They look that way—sort of proud and finicky
and stuck up, but maybe the country’ll do
them lots of good. They’re most certain to
like Susy after they really get to know her.
She’s so sensible and nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure thing,” agreed Archibald. “Nothing
like living in the country for giving one
a sense of values.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy’s face was flushed with excitement.
Her lips and eyes were brimming with smiles
as she waited to be tossed up to the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been on Susy and on Mr. Frisbie’s
Dick,” she said, her voice trembling a little
with eagerness, “but never on a real, prancy
riding horse like Zip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not afraid?” Archibald asked, noticing
the quiver of the voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid? Me? Not a bit. Some way or
other I always forget to be afraid of things
till afterwards; but I’m so excited that my
throat’s all shirred up in puckers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour he taught her the laws of bit
and bridle and saddle and horse nature; and
she took to it all, as a duck takes to water,
quick, fearless, bubbling over with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll make a horsewoman, Peg,” Archibald
said, as he lifted her down from the saddle
at last. “I’ll have you jumping fences,
before the summer is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Moran used to. She’d make her
horse jump anything. Mr. Meredith and she
didn’t pay a bit of attention to fences—unless
there was something they didn’t want to
trample down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald turned to her quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meredith? Who’s Meredith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen settled herself comfortably for a bit
of gossip. She loved to tell Archibald about
people. He was always so interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he’s the one that’s going to marry
Miss Moran,” she explained. “Anyway,
that’s what everybody thinks; but they don’t
seem to be in a very big hurry about it. He’s
awfully rich and he goes scooting off to Europe
and around the world and everywhere;
but he comes up here every summer and stays
a long while—over in Pittsfield. I guess he
couldn’t stand boarding anywhere around
here. He looks as if he’d be real particular.
But he comes over most every day in a motor
car, and he and Miss Moran have perfectly
beautiful times. He’s lots older than she is—only
I don’t believe he’s as old as his hair
is. It’s gray; but his face doesn’t match it
very well—except his eyes. Sometimes they
look sort of old and sad. He’s real handsome—and
nice too; only he’s nice in a proud
way—not a bit like you. I couldn’t ever see
to him. I wouldn’t suit—but he’d buy me
anything I needed—if somebody’d tell him I
needed it. I guess most rich people are like
that. They want to be kind to poor folks, but
they don’t know how. I don’t see how you
ever found out exactly the right way. It isn’t
just giving money. It’s being friends. Mr.
Meredith couldn’t neighbor the way you do,
no matter how hard he tried. Miss Moran
takes him around to see folks and he’s as nice
and polite as can be; but everybody knows
he’s come just to please her and that he’ll
never come again unless she brings him. He
gave the money for the free library down in
Pisgah and he fixed up the schoolhouse, and
when Joe Daniels got hurt last summer Mr.
Meredith had a big doctor come all the way
from New York to mend Joe’s back, and when
the Potters were going to be put out of their
house and hadn’t a bit of money he paid off
the mortgage and got Mr. Potter a job over
in Pittsfield—but he didn’t do any of it for
the Valley. He did it for Miss Moran. I’ll
bet he wouldn’t know Joe Daniels or Mr.
Potter if he’d meet them on the road. So,
you see, nobody bothers about being grateful
to him. They’re just grateful to Miss
Moran. I suppose she’s grateful to him, and
that’s all he wants; but I’d hate not to get
more fun out of doing things for people than
he does. I’d want to see them being happy
because I’d done the things, wouldn’t you?
My stars, but I do love to see people being
happy, when it’s my doings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think Miss Moran is going
to marry him?” Archibald asked. He
did not seem as interested in abstract discussions
as he usually did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, anybody can see that he wants her
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen thought it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know that she wants to
so very hard; but I guess she doesn’t mind.
He’s so awfully good to her and she’s known
him for years and years and her father thought
a heap of him—Ellen told me that—and you
know it’s nice and comfortable to have somebody
looking out for you and loving you better
than anything. Miss Moran gets lonesome
sometimes. It’s all right about neighboring,
but you do need somebody special—only
it seems as if I’d like to be more excited
about it, if I were going to marry anybody—and
I’d want him younger. Gray hair’s
elegant looking; but I think a lover ought
to have brown hair, don’t you? Yellow
wouldn’t be as bad as gray; but I’d choose
brown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Ellen tell you anything else about
him?” Pegeen shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing much. Ellen never does talk
much; but I asked her one day whether Miss
Moran had known Mr. Meredith a long time
and that’s how she came to tell me about her
father’s thinking so much of him. I don’t
believe Ellen wants them to get married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” There was a note of eagerness
in Archibald’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. She said he was a fine
man and all; but that springtime was mating
time; and then she folded up her lips the way
she does when she doesn’t like things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald dropped the subject, mounted his
horse, and took Zip’s bridle rein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going over to see whether Miss
Moran feels like riding,” he said crisply.
There was an aggressive air about him as he
rode away, and Pegeen watched him with puzzled
eyes until he disappeared around a bend
in the road. Then she seated herself and
tried to accommodate Boots and Wiggles and
Spunky in her small gingham lap, all at one
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wiggles,” she said seriously, “I don’t believe
he liked it about Mr. Meredith. No,
sir; he didn’t like it one bit. Do you suppose?—Oh,
my stars, Wiggles, wouldn’t it be
lovely?” She patted Boots’ back with an experienced
hand until he had traveled far into
Slumberland. Then she turned once more to
the pup, who sat waiting with his head on one
side and his intelligent brown eyes fixed on
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wiggles,” she said, “you can bite Mr.
Meredith when he comes. I won’t care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pup gave an ecstatic lunge and licked
her cheek with his wet, red tongue. She
laughed, as she wiped off the kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure you’d <span class='it'>love</span> to bite him,” she
said approvingly, “only you’d better do it
when he hasn’t got that white bull terrier of
his with him. Jimmy says it’s a terrible
fighter.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady felt like riding. She
felt so much like it that she sparkled in the
most amazing way at the mere mention of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such beauties,” she said, leaning across
the porch railing to pat the horses. “And
how fine for Peggy to learn to ride! She
wasn’t afraid, was she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid? Peg?” Archibald laughed the
idea to scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; that’s so,” agreed the Smiling Lady.
“She’s Irish. We’re the reckless lot. It’s
only ourselves we’ve to fear. Just a few minutes,
and I’ll get my habit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran upstairs and Archibald, waiting,
heard her singing somewhere, gay lilting
snatches of song that told of joy at the heart
of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In ten minutes a slim boyish figure came out
upon the porch. She was all in brown from
the crown of her soft felt hat to the toes of her
smart tan boots. The long coat had been made
by a tailor who knew his business. The soft
shirt and stock were eminently correct. She
was well turned out, this young Amazon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light pressure of a boot in his hand and
she was in the saddle. A moment more and
they were off into the sweet of Summitland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you along the back road and up
Witch Hill,” she said. “It has the name of
names for it, and how that ever happened I
can’t imagine. The loveliest places usually
have the worst names. There’s Hog Hill
Road. It’s a dream of loveliness, and how
any one ever had the heart to turn hogs loose
on it! Of course they say it’s the hog back
shape of the hill that gave it its name, but
when I ride there, even on the heavenliest day,
I fancy I hear gruntings. Now Witch Road
is all magic. It lives up to its name.
There’s a tradition that once upon a time an
old witch lived in a little hut that’s crumbling
away beside the road at the hilltop. I’ve an
idea she threw a spell over the whole hill and
it lingers. There’s Ezra Watts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Mr. Watts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man, standing in the doorway of a dilapidated
little house over whose forlornness a
willow wept miserably, muttered an almost
inaudible salutation. His weak, evil face did
not lighten even for the Smiling Lady.
Slouching, ragged, dirty, he stood in the sunshine
like a blot on the summer day, and stared
out at the riders sullenly from under a matted
thatch of thick, straggling, black hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleasant, friendly chap!” Archibald commented
lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then they forgot him, for they turned
from the sunshiny back road, into an enchanted
wood where a wide mossy trail wound gently,
gently upward through shifting light and
shade. Moist, pungent wood scents haunted
the air. The gurgle of running water, insistent,
mirthful, told that hidden among the ferns
and mosses a brook followed the road companionably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It comes out into the open farther up,” the
girl said as she listened, “but down here it
hides just for the fun of the thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A naiad’s trick,” Archibald suggested.
“Probably there are fauns abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; only the Little People,” she corrected.
“I’m all for Irish fairies myself. The poets
and the artists and the mythology classes have
taken the heart out of the Greek ideas, but the
Celts—Oh, well, we’ve had our own
troubles with poets, but they haven’t killed
and stuffed all our gods and heroes and Little
People yet. Father and I used to spend
months in Ireland every year and I’ve heard
such tales there—Oh, such tales! I’d always
the hope of seeing the Little People myself
or of stepping off into the Green World,
and finding my way to Tir ’nan Og. Things
like that seem so possible in Ireland, and some
way or other Witch Mill is the same for me.
It’s full of shapes I can’t quite see and voices
I can’t quite hear, and I look and listen and
wait. I’m always excited up here. The
wonderful thing might happen any moment.
There are places like that, you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was talking lightly but there were
dreams in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald’s thoughts ran back to the girl
of the puppies and kittens and babies in the
birch wood, to the girl of the fireside confidence
and the Irish love songs, to the gay,
grubby girl of the vegetable garden, to the
girl of the June roses and the heart for neighboring.
Then he came back to the girl of the
boyish clothes and the dreaming face who rode
beside him up the Witch Way, listening and
looking and waiting for the Wonderful
Thing; and he too found it easy to believe in
wonders. The enchanted wood was having
its way with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up and up they climbed. The road rose
very gradually, winding its leisurely way
through glades and glens, losing itself among
pine shadows, loafing across sunlit clearings;
and always at its side was the brook, whispering
and chuckling and hinting at mysteries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It comes from a great spring at the very
top of the hill beside the witch’s cottage,” the
Smiling Lady said as she leaned to watch the
sunlight playing over smooth brown stones
beneath the liquid green of a fern-fringed
pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I usually lunch up there—and by the same
token I’ve sandwiches in my pockets now.
Nature worship’s an appetizing thing and
Ellen knows it, but I didn’t give her time to
do her best to-day and it’s a nuisance to carry
more than sandwiches anyway. Supper will
be waiting when we go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come up here often?” the man asked.
Back of the question there was an eagerness,
even a protest. It had occurred to him that
Meredith and she had ridden up this way and
lunched beside the Witch’s Well; and there
was something about the idea that he found unpleasant,
most unpleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, often,” she was saying.—“Or at
least I did come when I had my horse. It’s
a long walk and the road isn’t very practicable
for driving. I’ve had beautiful days up
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not ask with whom she had shared
them and he assured himself stoutly that the
matter was of no importance to him anyway—only,
of course, a man whom Peg and Nora
didn’t like—Personally, he was altogether
unconcerned. Oh, altogether—still he rather
hoped she had not brought Meredith up Witch
Way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road found the hilltop at last and wandered
off, inconsequently along the ridge; but
the brook and the Girl and the Man stayed
behind at the Witch’s Well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It lay cool and gleaming among moss-covered
rocks. Little ferns and lush green
grasses crept down between the rocks to peer
into the water. A great old tree flung shadows
down upon it. Under the tree a mossy
cushion invited, promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady slipped from her saddle
before Archibald could reach her and dropped
down beside the well with a sigh of content.
When the man came back from tying the
horses in the shade, she was leaning against the
huge tree trunk, her hat thrown on the ground
beside her—a Rosalind in ultra modern doublet
and hose and fair enough to justify an Orlando
in hanging verses on all the trees of the
enchanted wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen had been quite truthful. “Sometimes
they did show.” For an instant a vision
of the polite and embarrassed bachelor clergyman
in Pisgah, of the perturbed ladies’ aid
society and the agitated Valley censors caused
Archibald’s lips to twitch nervously, but he
smothered the smile at its birth and stretched
himself out luxuriously on the moss at the
neatly booted feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in riding breeches and boots she was
more utterly without self-consciousness, more
simply, adorably feminine than any other
woman in muslin and blue ribbons. It would
be blind virtue that could call the Smiling
Lady immodest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could have loved that witch,” he said
lazily, closing his eyes the better to feel the
moss beneath his head and the breeze on his
cheeks and to hear the drip, drip of water
trickling among the rocks, and then opening
them hastily not to lose sight of the face against
the background of rugged bark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve felt that way myself,” the girl confessed.—“A
woman who would come away
up here into the quiet places and settle down
with the forest at her back and the spring near
her door and the whole Valley spread out before
her eyes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a heavenly sweet place to sit on a summer’s
day, weaving spells, isn’t it? They say
she was old and ugly, but I think that was only
when she went down among the Valley folk.
Up here she must have been young and beautiful
and she smiled a wonderful smile as she
worked enchantment. I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s believable,” admitted the man who
was watching her face. It was easy, astonishingly
easy, for him to believe in a witch who
was young and beautiful and who sat on a hilltop
smiling and working enchantment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They idled the afternoon away with talk
and laughter and drowsy silences; and being
very humanly hungry in the midst of all the
glamour, they finally ate Ellen’s six sandwiches
and sighed for more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next time,” said the Smiling Lady,
“we will bring a knapsack luncheon and make
tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next time!” He liked the promise in
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose to her knees and leaning over the
spring cupped her hands and drank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew,” she said seriously, looking back
across her shoulder at Archibald, “that it’s
the Well at the World’s End?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guessed it,” he said as seriously.</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“And whoso drinks the nine drops shall win his heart’s desire,</p>
<p class='line0'>At the Well o’ the World’s End,”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>she quoted softly. Then she leaned toward
him, laughing, and touched his lips nine times
with the cool wet forefinger of a dripping
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one reckless moment, he was tempted to
seize the daring hand, to hold it fast and kiss
it, from pink finger tips to blue veined wrist.
With any other woman he had ever known he
would have dared it, with any other woman
the thing would have been a challenge—but
he looked into the laughing face so near him,
and buried his hands in the moss beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was different. It was too much to risk—this
blessed comradeship. He did not
dare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall win his heart’s desire,” he echoed.
“And if he does not know the desire of his
heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day he will learn it and then he will
be glad of the nine drops from the Well o’
the World’s End.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald closed his eyes and lay quiet, but
there was tumult in his thoughts. In May he
had been so sure that he knew the face of his
heart’s desire, had been mad with the beauty
of it, hungered and thirsted for it, broken
heart and spirit in pursuit of it In May!—Now,
in July, he could feel the cool touch
of the nine drops from the Well o’ the World’s
End without any stirring of the old longing,
any throb of the old pain. The fever had
died quite out of him and the face that looked
at him from that faraway Maytime, was beautiful—but
not the face of his heart’s desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Happy Valley had done it. The
Happy Valley and Pegeen and his Smiling
Lady, and he was ashamed to have been so
quickly cured, so light of love, yet glad with
the gladness of one who wakens from long illness
and pain and fevered dreams, to consciousness
and peace and the face of a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened his eyes and looked up at the
Smiling Lady. “The face of a friend.” The
thought did not quite satisfy him. Friendship
seemed lukewarm business for Witch Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” he said, “whether you are as
understanding as you seem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The laughter died out of her face. She
looked at him with quiet eyes and waited.
She was used to confidences, this girl whom the
Valley loved and trusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you understand a man’s having
made a fool of himself over a woman—all
kinds of a fool—tossing aside his ideals and
ambitions and hopes for love of her, letting
her fool him to the limit—and then crawling
away into hiding with his hurt and his bitterness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady nodded gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said; “I could understand that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man raised himself on his elbow and
looked into the quiet eyes. There were incredulity,
wonder, and something that was
part shame, part gladness, and wholly boyish
in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if the man, after all his struggle and
unhappiness, should suddenly find himself
whole, clean quit of the pain and the desire,
glad of life again and eager for happiness—could
you understand that? This is a place
for oracles. Read me the riddle. What is
a man worth to whom that thing can happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was self-contempt in his voice, but
pleading in his eyes. Perhaps, in her merciful
heart, this Smiling Lady could find charity
for a man who had wasted himself on a love
that had not even the excuse of greatness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is worthy of what he can win,” the girl
said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing less Delphic than that for a man
with the nine drops on his lips?” Archibald
urged. She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no promise that the water will
give him whatever he happens to want,” she
said. “He’s to win his heart’s desire; but he
must prove that he knows the one desire of his
heart and is worthy of it, before it is given to
him.—That’s the way I’d read the riddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought it over and nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fair—but when he has proved
it?—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet and stood looking
out over the Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he will meet the Wonderful Thing,”
she said. She laughed as she said it, striving
to put their talk back into the realm of
whimsy; but her eyes were very sweet, and
looking down into them the man, who had
risen and stood beside her, had a vague
glimpse of the Wonderful Thing coming to
meet him along mysterious, enchanted ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode home through the sunset, and
Archibald stayed for supper in the house
among the maples, but after that moment on
the hilltop, their talk was all of impersonal
things. The girl led and the man followed.
They discussed the advisability of draining
the east meadow and the probable effect of
spraying the cabbages with kerosene emulsion
and the Valley’s need of a social center. Not
for an instant was sentiment allowed to show
its head, yet Archibald went back to the shack
with a singing heart He wakened the next
morning with an odd sense of having journeyed
in a far country and come back to a
familiar world where all was not quite as it
had been before his going; and, puzzling over
the change, he came face to face with the
truth. He was in love with the Smiling
Lady. He had been in love with her ever
since his first glimpse of her; but it had taken
Witch Hill magic to clear the fog from his
brain. He sprang from bed hastily, eager to
be up and about, in a world new made; and
Pegeen, in the kitchen, heard him whistling
gaily as he dressed. The past clutched at
him and he shook it off with a laugh. Ghosts
were foolish, futile things—but his whistle
ceased abruptly on a high note as, looking
eagerly into the future, he was confronted by
a man with graying hair and tired eyes. He
had forgotten Meredith; and, for a moment,
the thought of him sluiced his warm happiness
with chilling doubt; but he shook it off, too.
Hadn’t the nine drops touched his lips and
wasn’t he sure now, sure beyond possibility
of mistake, that he knew his heart’s desire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mood of exultant happiness lasted until
he met Nora Moran again. Then its glad
certainty wavered and doubts came creeping
in; for things, in the prosaic Valley world,
were not as they had been on Witch Hill. In
some mysterious way, his lady had clothed
herself in aloofness. It was not that she was
not kind. There was nothing of which he
could take hold, nothing of which he could
demand an explanation. She was very
friendly, very gracious, but the old intimacy
was lacking and not, by any force or strategy,
could he manage to see her alone. For some
reason, she had gone within herself and gently
closed the door; and, though he rebelled
against her withdrawal, he was afraid he understood
it. She had taken alarm, there beside
the Witch’s Well, had realized that he
wanted more than friendship, and, being
promised to another man— Yes; that must
be it. She was not free and she wanted to
warn him in time, before there could be need
of words, before he could give her face to his
heart’s desire and take the wrong road for
happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was like the Smiling Lady. She was
no cheap coquette. It was not in her to deal
unfairly. If she had given her love, even if
she had given only her promise to some one
else, then she was doing only what a woman
like her would do; and he must accept it as a
man she could make her friend would accept
it. Only—there was a chance that he was misreading
her mood, that gossip was wrong, that
Meredith was nothing more to her than an old
and dear friend. While there was a doubt,
one might fight against exile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his perplexity he turned to Ellen. She
had always shown her liking for him. She
would tell him the truth, unless loyalty to her
mistress forbade. One afternoon, when he
had ridden up to the house among the maples
only to be told that its lady was out and away
somewhere, he spoke what was in his thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman looked at him kindly with
her shrewd, far-seeing eyes, but was noncommittal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, there’s nothin’, sir. Herself is away
somewhere for a walk. She’s fair set on
roamin’ these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brushed evasion aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, Ellen, if you can tell me without
betraying confidence; Is Miss Moran engaged
to this Mr. Meredith of whom I hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The homely Irish face softened to sympathy
for an instant, then went back to its reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is that, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other questions burning his lips,
but he forced them back. One does not ask
a servant whether her mistress loves the man
she means to marry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Ellen,” he said simply, as he
turned away. He was in the saddle, when the
woman who had stood watching him stepped
to his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Twas her father’s doin’, God rest his
soul,” she said. Before he could answer, she
had gone swiftly into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald rode away, repeating the words
to himself. “’Twas her father’s doin’.”
Now, why had she told him that? Did she
mean him to understand that the girl’s own
heart was not in the marriage? Did she think
that it lay in his power to interfere? Did she
believe that her mistress cared more for him
than for the man she had promised to marry?
For a moment or two, his heart beat high.
Then again it was a leaden weight. The
Smiling Lady was not to be swept off her feet
by any lover. Since she had given her word
to Meredith, perhaps to her father too,—No;
she would not listen, if he should plead;
and, even if she would, there were things no
fellow could do. He had never believed that
all was fair either in love or in war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mrs. Neal who brought him word of
Meredith’s arrival. She billowed into the
shack one morning to borrow some coffee and
settled into the largest of the chairs to rest
and gossip, while Pegeen went after the coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Met Miss Moran’s beau yet?” she asked.
“No? Well, I guess he just come yesterday.
They went by our house this morning and she
stopped to ask about a ham I’d promised her.
Pretty as a picture, she looked. Pinkish,
soft sort of a veil around her head, and her
cheeks pinker. They make a mighty hansome
couple. I’ll say that for them, even if he is
mite old for her. I should say he’d make a
first-rate husband—kind as any woman could
ask. You can see that in his face and in his
ways, only he can’t help being quiet and a
little bit stiff—kind of like a pudding where
you’ve used too much gelatin but got the flavor
all right. John, that works down at Miss
Moran’s, told Neal last night that he’d heard
they was going to be married this fall and go
off to Egypt or some heathen place like that
for the winter. I tell you, the Valley’ll miss
Miss Moran.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; she’ll be missed.” Archibald admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy,” he said, after their neighbor had
gone away, “you’ll have to keep me hard at
my gardening and my neighboring. It isn’t
going to be easy for me to be contented all the
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yessir.” There was a trace of anxiety in
her ready smile. Something was wrong in his
face and voice and she was quick to notice it.
“The garden doesn’t need much now; but
neighbors always need a lot. Shall we go and
see the Kelleys this afternoon? He’s up now;
but he isn’t well enough to work and she says
he gets awfully lonesome and discouraged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In their way to the Kelleys they stopped at
the house under the maples. Archibald proposed
it. He wanted to meet the man the
Smiling Lady was going to marry; wanted to
meet him and have done with it. When a
dream refused to lie down decently and die
of its own accord, the thing to do with it was
to kill it and the sooner, the better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he and Pegeen made their call on the
Smiling Lady, finding a warm welcome—and
Richard Meredith, which was what Archibald
had expected. He took the measure of the
man, as he shook hands with him and, involuntarily,
his hand tightened. This was a
man. He liked the quiet manner, the quiet
voice, the air of distinction, the refinement and
strength of the mouth, the kindness in the eyes—but,
as he noted the fine lines about the kind
eyes and the gray hair above them, his heart
cried out Ellen’s protest. Springtime was
mating time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady was quiet, too, that afternoon.
She and Archibald talked together
over the teacups, while Pegeen sat in the hammock
with Richard Meredith—at his invitation;
and the teacup talk of casual things was
punctuated by gay little peals of laughter from
the child and deeper answering laughter from
the man beside her. They seemed to be getting
on famously together, those two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” Pegeen announced to Archibald,
when an hour later they rode away, “I
honestly believe I could see to Mr. Meredith
after all. I never really talked to him before
and he isn’t a bit the way I thought he was.
He isn’t proud inside atall; and, if he wasn’t
going to marry Miss Moran, so that he can’t
possibly need anything, I’d think he sort of
needed seeing to. There’s a lonesomey look
in his eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better than a lonesomey feeling in
his heart,” Archibald said with a shade of bitterness
in his voice. Meredith was all right;
but he didn’t care to hear Peggy praising him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned into the back road as he spoke;
and, far ahead, by the roadside, he saw a willow
tree mourning forlornly over a tumble-down
cottage. A sudden whim seized him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you take him on?” the Smiling
Lady had asked. Perhaps, some very strenuous
neighboring would be good for this bitter
mood of his.</p>

<h1 id='t5408'>IX</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Peg,” Archibald said, “let’s call on
Ezra Watts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked surprised, a bit doubtful, but her
sporting blood rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” she agreed promptly. “He
won’t let us neighbor and I expect the dirt’s
something terrible; but I’d just as soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they dismounted in front of the cottage,
Ezra’s terrier came running out of the door.
He was barking, but not angrily—urgently
rather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d think he was inviting us in,” Pegeen
said, as she watched the dog run toward the
door, come back to bark eagerly, and run forward
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More hospitable than his master, I should
say,” Archibald commented. “I wonder if
the man is home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the door which stood partly
open, and rapped on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sound came from within. Archibald
rapped again. The terrier ran through the
opening and barked encouragement across his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe something’s the matter,” said
Pegeen suddenly. “Let’s go in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pushed the door open and before Archibald
could stop her stepped inside. He followed
her and they stood in a filthy little room
that had once been the parlor of the house.
Moldy paper was hanging from the walls.
Much of the plaster had fallen from the ceiling
and lay where it fell. One or two rickety
chairs were the only attempt at furnishing and
the accumulated dirt of years littered the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one was in sight, but the dog ran on into
a back room and from there the intruder heard
a low mumbling voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay here, Peg,” Archibald said authoritatively.
“He’s drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her instinct drove her quickly forward,
in spite of his command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s sick,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing in the second doorway they looked
into a room as dirty and neglected as the first,
but they did not notice walls or ceiling or floor,
for on a cot by the farther wall lay Ezra Watts,
haggard, ghastly, purple-faced, unseeing, tossing
restlessly on an unspeakably dirty bed and
muttering meaningless things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a little cry of pity, Pegeen ran toward
him, but Archibald caught her in his arms and
lifting her bodily, carried her into the next
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Peg,” he said quietly, as he put her
down. “The man has fever. There’s no telling
what the disease is. I can’t have you taking
chances. You can help most by getting
on Zip and riding down to Miss Moran’s to
telephone for Doctor Fullerton. Tell him
what’s wrong and that I want him at once.
Then ask Miss Moran for some old linen she
can spare and some soap and bring them to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re going to stay,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who’ll take care of me if I get sick
unless you keep in shape for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The argument was overwhelming. She allowed
him to lift her to the saddle and pelted
away down the road at a breakneck pace,
while Archibald went back into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found an old stove in the kitchen and
made a fire in it Then he filled a kettle with
fresh water and set it over the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever the doctor’s verdict was, hot water
was sure to be needed in that house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen was back in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Moran and Mr. Meredith have gone
motoring,” she said breathlessly, as Archibald
lifted her from the horse, “but Ellen’s coming.
John’s going to bring her over in the cart.
I’ve got some sheets and towels and a blanket
and a cake of soap, but she’ll have more linen
and scrubbing brushes and lots of cleaning
things. There comes the doctor now. I hear
his car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A muddy battered roadster came plunging
up the crooked road at reckless speed and a
tall, wiry, competent-looking man sprang out
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just caught me. I was rolling out of the
yard when they yelled after me. Didn’t even
have to crank up. So the germs have downed
Ezra at last! Nature does get back at a man
in time. Lord, what a hole!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went briskly through the front room,
growling anathemas at the foulness, and bent
over the tossing, muttering man on the bed
with as lively an interest as though the patient
had not been the black sheep of the Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A body was a body to Dr. Fullerton, and his
business was saving bodies. The harder the
battle, the greater his interest and enjoyment.
As to the value of the salvage to the community—that
was the community’s business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll patch up the tenements,” he said to the
gentle, nervous, little Protestant minister in
Pisgah. “It’s up to you and Father Rafferty
to see that your people lead decent lives in
them.”—But when the little man or the
priest needed backing up with work or money,
it was usually Dr. Fullerton who lent the hand
or the dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was all doctor as he examined Ezra
Watts, keen eyed, deft fingered, intent, but as
he straightened himself and looked down at
the dirty, unshaven face, the keenness gave way
to kindliness in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing contagious,” he said shortly.
“Pneumonia with some complications. Not
much show for him except in his tough constitution.
He never did drink, for all his cussedness;
and that’s in his favor now. Fed himself
enough, such as it was and it was plain
food with no knick-knacks. That counts for
him too. It’s the high-living, robust fellows
that wink out with pneumonia. Shouldn’t
wonder if we’d pull him through provided we
can get him clean without killing him. Got
to have a scrubber and a nurse here and quick
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about me?” Archibald asked.
“Strong and willing at scrubbing and nursing
but not a professional in either line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call Peggy,” ordered the doctor. “She’s
one of my best nurses; but you and I’ll have
to turn in and give him a bath before we hand
him over to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald found Pegeen fairly dancing with
eagerness and impatience on the doorstep.
“Oh, my stars, I’m so glad it isn’t catching,”
she said, darting past him into the sick room.
“I couldn’t have stood it not to be able to see
him. There’s such a splendid lot to do. It’s
awful when there isn’t anything you can do
but sit around and wait. This is the very best
chance I ever had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you keep the fire roaring in the
kitchen,” ordered the doctor, “and warm some
of those towels and the blanket for us and see
that there’s plenty of hot water. Archibald
and I are going to give Ezra’s system the worst
shock it has had since childhood. After that’s
over, you can help us clean the front room a bit
and move him in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flew into the kitchen with the towels
and blanket, quick, noiseless, radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Fullerton grinned as he watched her
go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny what a passion for seeing to people
that youngster has,” he said, “and what a
corker she is at it, too. She’s helped me in
some tight places, child as she is. Once it
was sewing a man up—bad mowing-machine
accident. His wife couldn’t stand by; but
Peg could. White as a sheet, but never batted
an eye until she’d done all I needed. Then
she went away quietly into the yard and keeled
over in a faint—but not till her job was done,
mind you. That’s Peg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen and John arrived during the progress
of the bath, and, within an hour, the sick man
lay between white, lavender-scented sheets in
a room that, while forlorn, was amazingly
clean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he comes out of the fever, he’ll
think he’s died and gone to hell,” Dr. Fullerton
prophesied. “A clean eternity would be
about the worst future Ezra could figure out.
Who’s going to look after him, while I see to
some of my other patients?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me,” announced Peg, making up in enthusiasm
what she lacked in grammer.
“Boots is at Mrs. Neal’s and it won’t hurt Wiggles
and Spunky and Peterkin to go without
supper once, and Ellen’ll give you some supper,
Mr. Archibald. Won’t you, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Nora would want me to be staying
here,” protested Ellen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald settled the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peg and I will stay,” he said, “and maybe
Ellen will send John over with a bite for us.
We’ll have provisions in here by to-morrow
and the back room fit to be lived in. He
couldn’t be moved, I suppose, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Fullerton shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finish him,” he said. “I’ll have Miss
Kirby down from Albany to-morrow morning.
She’s the only nurse I know who likes
cases of this sort—eats ’em up. Can’t be too
bad for her. Only thing she balks at is a sick
millionaire. Abnormal woman, but a rattling
good nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t I—” began Pegeen. She
looked woefully disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t.” The doctor was firm.
“Not until after he’s over the ridge one way
or the other. Then there’ll be enough for
you and anybody that applies. Just shows
what a frost virtue is. I’ve had highly respectable
patients neglected and here’s a spirited
contest for the privilege of taking care of
Ezra, who’s as worthless a customer as you’d
find in a day’s journey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Doctor, he’s so sick!” Pegeen was distressed,
shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s not dead. It’s only after they’re
dead that we can’t speak ill of them. I’m not
going to let Ezra die, so I feel perfectly free
to tell the truth about him. There’s the
medicine. Nothing much to do at this stage
of the game. I’ll be back in an hour and
bring a tank of oxygen down to have it handy.
Don’t you fret, Peggy. He’s going to rob
many a hen-roost yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went away, driving in utter defiance of
the speed laws. John and Ellen drove off
home, and Peg and Archibald sat down in two
of the rickety chairs near the bed upon which
the transformed Ezra lay, breathing heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, Miss Pegeen O’Neill, is what comes
of neighboring,” said Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; isn’t it splendid?” Peg was important,
shiny-eyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come to think of it, I don’t know but
what it is,” admitted the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t he look different when he’s
clean?”—Pegeen lowered her voice to sick-room
pitch, but she was too excited to keep
still and Ezra would not hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so he’s not beautiful,”—Archibald
studied the face on the pillow as he spoke. A
weak, evil face it was even now when the man’s
spirit did not look out through his eyes, but
Peg’s tender heart could not find helplessness
quite unbeautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sort of think he was a good looking little
boy,” she said. “His nose is straight and nice
and his mouth could have been real sweet if
he hadn’t spoiled it. I shouldn’t wonder a
bit if his mother’d been awfully proud of him
when she got him all fixed up to go somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face was wistful, sweet with pity for
the little boy of the long ago, whom life had
wrecked, and the picture her words had called
up made Archibald look at the sick man with
kinder eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Peg! Peg!” he murmured softly,
“what a friend to sinners and weaklings you
are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got to have friends,” said Pegeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor came back after a while. The
Smiling Lady and Richard Meredith came
too, and Mrs. Benderby, after her day of ironing
and her three-mile walk home, toiled up
the Back Road to see if there was anything
she could do to help. Mr. Neal rode over
and offered to spend the night, but, in the end,
Archibald and the doctor stayed. Pegeen,
protesting stoutly, was carried off home by
Miss Moran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing you could do to-night, Peggy,”
said the doctor. “Save your ammunition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life and Death stood beside the bed in the
little house on the Back Road that night; but
it was Death who turned and went away in the
gray of the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll do now,” said the doctor, “but it was
touch and go for a while. The oxygen held
him. Sometimes I wonder—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His strong jaw set once more in fighting
grimness— “But it isn’t up to me to wonder.
Beating Death, in a catch-as-catch-can, is my
end of the job, and I rather think I’ve downed
him this time. What life will do with the
man is another story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to help tell the story,”—Archibald
had never stood by in such a fight as the
doctor had fought that night and the experience
had left him with a humble consciousness
of his own uselessness, a strong desire to
play a manlier part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Fullerton looked at him sharply from
under heavy eyebrows that gave his face a misleading
fierceness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t sentimentalize, man,” he said
bluntly. “It takes people that way sometimes—running
up against Death and barely
slamming the door in his face—but don’t imagine
the close shave will change Ezra any
more than his bath will. He’ll be as mean
and as dirty as ever in a few weeks. We’ve
done our damnedest for him to-night, but
we’re the ones benefited by it. Life’s a
doubtful blessing to Ezra. Help him if you
want to, but do it with your eyes open and
because you want to, not because you expect
to reform him. He isn’t the reforming
kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald thought his words over after
he had gone. Probably they were true—but
on their heels came other words. “I believe
there’s a decent scrap of Soul hidden away
somewhere in Ezra, hidden so deep that he
himself doesn’t suspect it’s there,” Nora
Moran had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder a bit if his mother had
been awfully proud of him.” It was Pegeen
who had said that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who could tell? One needn’t sentimentalize,
but one might as well give a man the
benefit of the doubt. That was neighboring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse from Albany came and ate up
the case, according to prophecy, but in a few
days she went away to meet direr needs, and
then Pegeen’s turn came. She was in her element,
and Ezra, a limp edition of his former
self, showed a flattering satisfaction in the
change from Miss Kirby’s ministrations to
Peggy’s. Surliness was as natural to him as
breathing and he was no angel patient; but
it was quite useless to be surly with Peg. She
ignored it, and went her cheerful, tolerant
way, coddling, coaxing, encouraging, tyrannizing,
amusing, unmoved by stubbornness or
rudeness or anger or ingratitude, obeying the
doctor’s orders and, where the orders ended,
“seeing to” Ezra according to her own ideas
of the way the thing should be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald, and Miss Moran, and Mrs.
Benderby, stayed with her in turn, but the case
was hers, and Dr. Fullerton always addressed
her as “Nurse O’Neill,” to her profound satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald missed her miserably at the
shack. Mrs. Benderby was looking after
him. She had called the doctor in as he drove
by one evening during the first week of Ezra’s
illness; and after an examination he had told
her kindly but frankly that her days for hard
work were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may live for many years,” he said;
“live comfortably, too, but no more washing
and ironing and scrubbing, Mrs. Benderby.
We’ll have to find something easier for you to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke as though finding it would be the
simplest matter imaginable and indeed it
proved so; for Archibald, temporarily bereft
of Peggy and robbed of self-reliance through
many weeks of being “seen to” by that young
person, was desperately in need of feminine
ministrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the thing for you,” the doctor said
heartily, as he told Mrs. Benderby of Archibald’s
forlorn plight “When Peg gets
through with Ezra we’ll have something else
for you.” So there were good meals and
cleanliness at the shack, but oh, the loneliness
of the place! Mrs. Benderby was devoted,
she was kind, but she had her limitations.
Pegeen, so it seemed to Archibald as he sighed
for her, had none. He was lonely without
her, infernally lonely, and he told her so.
She was distressed about it, but Ezra needed
her most and that settled the matter so far as
she was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m homesick. I’m most crazy to go
home,” she confessed, “but I wouldn’t for
anything. Sometimes I think he most likes
me; but he’s dreadfully ashamed of it. He’s
dreadfully ashamed of any nice feeling he has.
Isn’t that funny? After he says anything
pleasant, he swears right off quick for fear
you’ll think he meant it. I do wish I could
get him used to being nice so it wouldn’t hurt
him the way it does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Pegeen could not quite achieve that—Ezra
progressed to the point of being nice
occasionally but it always hurt him, and only
to Peggy did he even make the concession of
being very intermittently “nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Archibald and the doctor and all the
rest he wore as lowering a face and as ungracious
a manner as though they had been
cruelly abusing him instead of saving his life
and paying his expenses. Archibald found
the thing rather discouraging, but Dr. Fullerton
laughed over it unconcernedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott, man,” he said, when they
talked of it one day after a visit to the rapidly
convalescing invalid, “I don’t pull my patients
through because I expect gratitude. I do it
because it’s playing the game. That’s the
only satisfaction that amounts to anything.
Pick out a white man’s game and play it for
all there is in you. Then life’s worth living.”</p>

<h1 id='t5901'>X</h1>

<p class='pindent'>The day came when Ezra was well
enough to shift for himself and he gave
every one—including Pegeen—to understand
that he was glad to be rid of intruders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll seem mighty good to get back to living
as I please,” he said, as Peg, calmly autocratic
to the last, gave him a dose of medicine
before joining the doctor who was waiting to
drive her home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet it doesn’t.” She was amiable but
positive. “You’ll hate it and I’m sorry
you’ve got to do it, but I think maybe you’ll
take better care of yourself than you did.
Don’t forget your medicine after meals. If
you get into any trouble I’ll come over and
see to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ezra grunted derision, but she held out her
hand and smiled up at him so whole-heartedly
that he was surprised into an answering smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a queer one,” he said, “but you’re
better than most.” It was grudging, inadequate,
but coming from Ezra it was glowing
tribute, and Peggy went out to the car in high
spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to miss Ezra,” she said as the
doctor tucked her in. “Of course he isn’t
like Mr. Archibald, but I’ve got real fond of
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Smoke!” commented Dr. Fullerton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” she insisted, “and I’m sure now
that he likes me. He said I was better than
most. That’s a lot for Ezra to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s impassioned eulogy,” said the doctor,—“but,
Peg, speaking in cold blood, as doctor
to nurse and without any of Ezra’s overflowing
sentiment, I’ll admit that you <span class='it'>are</span> better
than most. You really ought to be trained for
a nurse, Peg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small girl’s face flushed with happiness
at the praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’d be lovely,” she said, “but I can’t, because
I’m going to be married and I guess my
own children will keep me pretty busy. I do
hope they’ll have measles and whooping
cough and all those things early. It’s so
much better, isn’t it? And it’ll take a lot of
time for eight of them to have everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a fact. It will,” agreed the doctor.
“You’re counting on eight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I guess that’s enough unless you have
perfect stacks of money. I want them all to
go to school. School’s so lovely. I’d have
liked awfully to go more, but there was always
somebody to see to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Fullerton gave her arm an affectionate
little squeeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know more than any of the rest of us
as it is, Peg. Schooling you would have been
‘gilding refined gold and painting the lily.’
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll undertake to
see all eight of those children through whooping
cough and measles and any blamed thing
they choose to have and I won’t charge you a
cent for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen looked immeasurably relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be perfectly splendid,” she said
happily. “Doctor’s bills do make lots of
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They trouble the doctors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Fullerton grinned ruefully as he admitted
it. A very large percentage of his patients
showed absolutely no interest in his bills
when he sent them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald and Wiggles were waiting for
Pegeen at the meadow bars and each welcomed
her after his own fashion. Wiggles
was the more exuberant of the two. Only by
sheer force was he kept from meeting a sudden
and violent death in his wild effort to
climb into the car before it stopped; and when
the small girl finally stood by the roadside, he
gave an exhibition of hysterical affection ill
befitting one of his stern sex. Archibald
merely took his pipe from his mouth and came
forward to lift Peg from the car, with a quiet,
“Well, here you are, Nurse O’Neill,” but the
satisfaction in his face was good to see, and
Dr. Fullerton chuckled over it as he went
spinning on down the Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That youngster has lit on her feet,” he told
himself contentedly. “Hanging over those
bars watching for her, for an hour, I’ll bet.
Wonder how much money the man has anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the three he had left behind on
the roadside were going happily up the
meadow slope to the shack. Archibald and
Peg went hand in hand and, as usual, she accommodated
her pace to his long easy stride
by a system of two steps and a skip, while
Wiggles gyrated excitedly about the two,
yelping his joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to come home, child?” the man
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She squeezed his hand lovingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad I’d like to do what Wiggles
is doing,” she said. “I feel as if I’d been
away two months instead of two weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make it two years,” he amended.
“That’s the length of time I’ve spent missing
you. What did I do before you happened
to me, Peg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needed seeing to. Gracious!
You’ve been doing something to the house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked just a trifle embarrassed, doubtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, Peg,” he said bluntly. “I never
did like your trotting back and forth night
and morning and looking after Mrs. Benderby
at all sorts of unearthly hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t hurt me,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it hurt me and things are different
now. I didn’t tell you about Mrs. Benderby
because I thought it might worry you,
but Dr. Fullerton says she has to stop going
out by the day.—Not seriously ill, you
know, but she’ll have to let up on very hard
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, isn’t that dreadful.” Pegeen’s
eyes were flooded with anxiety. “Isn’t it
lucky I’ve got some money? The rent’s
seven dollars and then meals—but I’ll have
plenty this summer and then maybe she’ll be
better, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless your dear heart,” Archibald interrupted.
“You aren’t going to spend your
money on her. I’ll look out for her—glad to—only
it seemed to me—she’s got used to being
up here now and seems to like it and she
could relieve you of the cooking—and I don’t
know how you feel about it, but I thought I’d
like to have both of you stay here with me.
I had the carpenter knock up a couple of
rooms at the side of the shack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped in the path and stared at him,
shining eyed, wondering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my stars!” she said in a hushed little
voice. “My stars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you like the idea?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like it!” The wonder in her face broke
up into little ripples of delight. “Like it!
Why it’s perfectly splendid! It’s the loveliest
thing I ever heard of! I could sit down
and cry the way I did when the larkspur happened—but
think of you wanting us—Mrs.
Benderby too! And everybody thought you
didn’t like folks at all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so myself,” admitted Archibald;
“but you see I hadn’t ever really known anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve got to run. I’ve simply got to.
Walking’s no good when you feel the way I
do, and I can’t wait to see the new rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scampered off up the path, with Wiggles
barking joyously before her, and when
Archibald reached the shack at a more leisurely
gait she had inspected the new rooms
and was sitting in the living-room, Wiggles
at her feet, Boots in her lap, and Spunky on
her shoulder, while Mrs. Benderby stood with
her hands on her hips looking down adoringly
at the Small Person in the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m home! I’m home! I’m home!”
Pegeen was singing to the laughing baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all home now,” Archibald said, as
he stood in the doorway and looked at her.
“You <span class='it'>are</span> the home, Peggy child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supper that night was a party. The Smiling
Lady had sent John over with a big bunch
of glorious blue larkspur. “Peg’s ‘glad’
flower is the flower for you all, to-night,” said
the word that came with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Benderby had made a cake with
pink icing and an amazing design in little red
candies around the edge of it, and there was
ice cream, a contribution from Mrs. Neal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like a birthday—only I never had this
kind of a birthday,” said Pegeen, as she
beamed across the blue flowers that, for all
their gladness, were not so glad as her face,
while Mrs. Benderby, torn between her ideal
of the solemnity appropriate in waiting on a
city gentleman and her sympathetic joy, hovered
round the table with relays of hot biscuit
and fried chicken, and Wiggles, having
been surreptitiously presented with a chicken
leg, by Peg—a thing entirely against her own
rules—sat on his haunches and begged for
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boots was asleep in the hammock and
Spunky, true to feline type, assumed a profound
indifference and sat on the hearth with
her front paws folded cozily under her and a
bored look on her little gray face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going to have this kind of birthdays
from now on—only more so,” Archibald
announced. “This is just an unbirthday
party. Wait till you see your birthday party.
When <span class='it'>is</span> your birthday, Peg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“September—the fifteenth. I’m glad I
wasn’t born in winter. Spring would have
been nicest. I’d have liked being born along
with everything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald dissented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t have done at all,” he said firmly.
“You were special—extra special. Autumn
needed you to keep it from being sad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Benderby wouldn’t allow Pegeen to
help with the dishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Other nights, maybe, if you want to, but
not to-night,” she insisted. So, as the afterglow
faded and the stars came out to look at
a blithe new moon Archibald and Peg sat once
more on their familiar doorstep. For a time
they were both silent, listening to the night
noises, watching the play of moonlight and
starlight across the meadow and the clutching
shadows on the wood’s edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if Ezra took his medicine after
supper,” Pegeen said suddenly. “I’d most
forgotten about him. Being terribly happy’s
sort of selfish, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when you are making other people
happy by being happy, and you are doing
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pressed her cheek against his shoulder
for an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, being so happy was what made me
remember Ezra. I suppose he doesn’t know
what it feels like. You see, he can’t; because
he doesn’t love anybody. You can’t have the
real, soaked-in, choky kind of being happy
unless you love somebody a whole lot and feel
sure the somebody loves you. I tried awfully
hard to love Ezra. I did honestly, and I did
get real fond of him, but you can’t exactly love
anybody that won’t be lovable. You can feel
sorry and kind and everything like that, but
loving’s different. I guess God’s the only
one that can go right ahead and love everybody
no matter what they’re like. It doesn’t
make any difference about sinners. I could
love sinners just as quick as scat, if they were
nice sinners that would love back; but I’m
afraid God will have to do the loving with
Ezra. I can’t get any further than liking
him, even if he does swear and act ugly. I
do hope he’ll take his medicine and change
the sheets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he won’t,” said Archibald encouragingly.
“Ezra’s now engaged in going back
to the blanket literally and figuratively, but
don’t fret about him, Peg. We’ll do all we
can for him, but you’re back on your old job
now and you’ll have to give your whole time
and attention to seeing to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mrs. Benderby and Boots and Wiggles
and Spunky,” added Pegeen. “Isn’t it
a lovely family!—and just think of my having
you all right here together—not having to
go away to see Mrs. Benderby or take Boots
home nights or anything. I used to hate leaving
you and sometimes I’d wake up in the
night and worry for fear you’d get sick here
all alone with nobody to see to you, and I’d
always hurry as fast as I could, coming up in
the morning for fear something had happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you!” Archibald rumpled the thick
black hair with an affectionate hand. “I
hated being left alone myself, not because I
was afraid of anything happening but because
the place was forlorn without you. Peggy,
Peggy! How you do creep into hearts and
settle down to housekeeping in them!”</p>

<h1 id='t6249'>XI</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Benderby proved herself a
most satisfactory addition to the family.
Just at first there was a ripple on the
surface because Pegeen jealously resented any
infringement of her rights in the matter of
seeing to Archibald, but the two had that out
promptly and satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this way, Peg,” the man explained seriously.
“Mrs. Benderby needs something to
do. She’ll feel dependent and unhappy if
she isn’t allowed to make herself useful, and
the only way she can make herself useful is
by cooking and washing dishes. It’s different
with you. Cooking and dish washing
were the least of the things you did for me.
You did them mighty well. I can’t deny that,
but you’ve fed my heart and washed the cobwebs
out of my eyes, and you can afford to turn
the cooking and dish washing over to somebody
else. I want you free to go with me
anywhere at any time. Your job is seeing to
my heart and soul, Peggy O’Neill. As long
as you can do that why should you give a hoot
who sees to my meals and dishes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a pig! I’m a horrid little pig,”
Peg always repented as enthusiastically as she
did everything else. “I’ll go and tell Mrs.
Benderby so right now. I was perfectly
snippy to her about coddling your eggs this
morning, but she can coddle away just as she
wants to, as long as she gets them right.
You’ve got to have them <span class='it'>right</span> though, and,
please, I’d so much rather plan what you’re
going to have for meals. I can do it better.
Honestly I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t a doubt of it,” said Archibald.
“Plan away—only don’t grudge Mrs. Benderby
the cook stove and the dish pan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All went smoothly after that. There was
more time for the neighboring expeditions, for
long walks and drives, for picnics, in which
Jimmy Dawes was usually included. He was
Pegeen’s humble slave, although he would
have suffered tortures rather than admit it.
He haunted the shack; but, ostensibly, his devotion
was for Archibald and the offerings he
laid at that amused young man’s feet were
many. He brought Archibald pailfuls of red
raspberries. Pegeen adored red raspberries.
He presented Archibald with bunches of pink
roses from Grandmother Dawes’ garden.
Pegeen was daft about pink roses. He caught
fish for Archibald’s breakfast. Fish was the
thing Pegeen liked best for breakfast. But to
Peg, herself, the boy was painstakingly off-hand
and brusk, giving her plainly to understand
that she was only a girl and must be kept
in her place. She submitted meekly and
wound him around her finger, after the immemorial
fashion of girls, even of very small
girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wound Archibald around the same slim
finger. He was what Peg would have called
“lonesomey” round the heart, during these
long summer days, and Pegeen was good for
lonely hearts. A world in which she loved
and petted and companioned and made merry
couldn’t be such a very forlorn place; and
making her happy was a consoling and satisfactory
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child’s thin little face had filled out.
The old anxious look had gone from her eyes.
The promise of beauty was fast finding fulfilment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you noticed how lovely Peggy is,
now-a-days?” Nora Moran asked Archibald
one afternoon, when he and she met in the Village
store, while Peg waited outside on Zip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was always lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Smiling Lady laughed at his quick
protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always,” she agreed, “but she’s getting
lovelier by the minute. One of these days she
will be wonderfully beautiful. There’s an
exquisite delicacy about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s perfectly strong and well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald’s voice held a note of alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely. I didn’t mean that she
looked frail—but she’ll never be the buxom,
dashing kind. Her beauty won’t jump at you.
It will haunt you. I think that Irish type is
the loveliest in the world—the black hair and
the deep blue eyes and the clear skin and the
flush that comes and goes—and when you add
the sweetness of Peg’s mouth and the love in
her eyes and the freckles on her impertinent
little nose—I rather think those freckles are
fading, though. They’ll soon be gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d miss them,” Archibald said regretfully.
“And I hope she won’t be a raving,
tearing beauty. She’d break her heart because
she couldn’t see to all the sighing swains.
I’m afraid she <span class='it'>is</span> headed that way, though.
I’ve noticed it myself—and she’s better
than good to look at. She has a way with
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He talked lightly; but he didn’t believe that
the black-haired, blue-eyed type was the loveliest
the world had to show. There was a certain
reddish gold hair that was neither brown
nor auburn; and there were eyes that were
sometimes the color of sea water over sand and
sometimes violet and sometimes darkly gray— Still,
Pegeen <span class='it'>was</span> blooming like a wild rose.
There was no doubt about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy noticed it, too. He commented
upon it one day when Pegeen and he had left
Archibald smoking lazily, after a picnic lunch,
and had gone off in search of berries for dessert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re better looking than you used to be,
Peg,” he said, staring critically at her across
a blueberry bush from which they were stripping
the fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh,” agreed Pegeen. Her mouth being
full of berries, she was temporarily incapable
of more eloquent assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy felt that he ought to snub her, for
her soul’s good; but really—in that pink sun-bonnet— Oh,
well girls were funny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do when Mr. Archibald
goes off and gets married?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen choked over her mouthful of berries
and looked at him, in wide-eyed dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy Dawes, it isn’t so,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly!” Jimmy’s tone was kindly contemptuous.
Girls always went off half-cocked.
“I didn’t say he was going right off
now and get married. I just asked you what
you’d do when he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he won’t.” She tried to feel hopeful;
but Jimmy wouldn’t allow it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe nothing! Of course he will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy sat back on her heels and put her
pail down. She had lost all interest in berrying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jimmy,” she sighed. “Whatever’d
you make me think about that for? Everything’s
so nice just as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but you’ll be getting married yourself
some day. Then what’d he do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if he’d wait till I grow up he could
marry me and then I could go right on seeing
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catch him waiting!” Jimmy’s emphasis
was scornful. It implied disrespect for Pegeen’s
charms; but she was not offended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I suppose not,” she agreed. “It’d be
an awfully long time and he’d be as old as
anything. Well, anyway, he isn’t keeping
company with anybody now; and when he does
go off and get married, I’ll just have to do the
best I can. Let’s go back. My pail’s full.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they stood up, side by side, the boy
looked down at the girl and a sudden red
warmed the brown of his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what, Peg,” he said. “You
grow up and marry me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheerful promptness of the consent was
most flattering; but, even at fifteen, the wooer
felt that something was lacking. For a moment
he hesitated, looking down into the frank
blue eyes. Then he laughed and took Peg’s
pail of berries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t you forget it. That’s all,” he
said with masterful gruffness, as he turned
away to find the trail. He had never carried
her pail before. Somewhere back in Pegeen’s
brain a disconcerting idea took form. Jimmy
was growing up. He’d be going away to
school next, and Mr. Archibald would get
married and have a wife to see to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She followed Jimmy’s sturdy figure down
the hill with lagging steps and her face was
very sober when they joined Archibald under
the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at him; but the attempt wasn’t
altogether successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not tired,” she said; “but, someway
or other, I feel lonesome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled her down on the grass and she
curled up comfortably beside him; but the subdued
mood lasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Peg?” Archibald
asked, as they stood in the doorway of the
shack, late that afternoon. He was in his riding
clothes and off to Pisgah to have Zip shod;
but he stopped to put a finger under Pegeen’s
chin and turn her face up to his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something’s wrong, dear. Tell me about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her long black lashes dropped over her
woeful eyes, the wild rose flush came into her
cheeks, her lips quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Peg!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hid her face against the front of his riding
coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t anything,” she said with a little sob
in her voice. “Honestly, it isn’t anything—only
I’ll be so—l-lonesome, when somebody
else sees to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he had a helpless sense of being
a bungling man. Then he sat down on the
doorstep and pulled her down beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now see here, Peg,” he said with simple
seriousness. “You are too sensible to spoil
our happiness by worrying over things that
may never happen or over things that aren’t
going to happen for a long time. One of these
days you’ll be going away to school. I’m going
to attend to that, and then you’ll be growing
up and traveling in Europe and going out
in society and I’ll need somebody to see to me
in the off times when you’re too busy. And
then you’ll be falling in love with some fine
chap and getting married and you’d feel
mighty bad if you had to go off knowing that
there wasn’t anybody to see to me properly
after you were gone. Now wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-y-yess,” faltered Peg. Her eyes were
perceptibly more cheerful. The bits about
school and Europe had appealed to her imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are,” Archibald summed up triumphantly.
“Of course I don’t need any one
else to see to me now, and I’m not going to
have anybody, and nobody could ever take
your place; but when you do go away to school
and to Europe and all that, you’d rather have
me married to somebody than leave me all at
loose ends, now wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen performed one of her amazing
about-face movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have to be married,” she said firmly.
“I wouldn’t budge a step, unless you were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, that’s all right; but there’s no
use bothering about it as long as you and I
can be together; and there’s small chance of
my marrying at all, Pegeen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The laughter had died out of him and he
stood looking down the Valley with eyes that
did not see the meadows or the distant hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, it’s this way, Peg. I can’t have
the girl I want and there’s no other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was pain in his voice and Pegeen
slipped a small hand into his. Not a word
did she say; but the grip of the little brown
hand and the sympathy in the great eyes were
comforting things. He shook off the blue
devils and smiled down at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s how it is, Pegeen—and now I’m
going to the blacksmith’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down in Pisgah, he found public opinion,
as represented by the men loafing about the
smithy, in a ferment. There had been another
barn burning during the previous night
and, though the value of the property destroyed
had been small, the fire seemed to have
been the proverbial last straw. Some of the
bolder and younger spirits of the community
were outspoken in their determination to defy
the law and take the matter into their own
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there ain’t proof, then guesswork’ll
have to do,” one of them said to Archibald
when he entered protest against the wild talk;
and even the older and more conservative men
in the crowd nodded assent. The camel’s
back was broken. Valley patience had given
out. No name was mentioned; but there was
no doubt as to the direction in which the guesswork
would point; and Archibald rode home,
puzzling over the degree of his responsibility
for Ezra Watts. He was inclined to think
with the rest of the community, that Ezra was
the barn burner; yet, though the suspected
man had been closely watched, nothing had
been discovered to connect him with the fires,
except that sometimes he had been seen abroad
on the nights when they occurred. More
than that was needed for justification of rough
handling and if the law could not reach Ezra,
the best thing that could happen for both him
and the community would be for him to go
away before any violent outbreak could occur.
Probably he would be only too glad to go, if
he were warned of the danger and given
money to smooth his way.</p>

<h1 id='t6616'>XII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald ate his late supper absent-mindedly
and spent his evening, as usual,
with Pegeen and Wiggles and his pipe.
Mrs. Benderby always dozed in the kitchen
after her supper dishes were washed, and
Spunky, like her big cousins of the jungle, always
answered the call to good hunting when
the night closed in; but Pegeen and Wiggles
and the man they loved kept each other company
in the living-room or on the doorstep
and, whether they were merry or quiet, all
three found content at the day’s end, in being
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At their usual early bedtime, Pegeen rose
and lighted the bedroom candles; but, instead
of taking his candle, Archibald reached for his
cap which hung beside the door. He had decided
to see Ezra before he slept and send him
away from the Valley, if any reasonable
amount of persuasion or money would move
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sleepy, Peg,” he said. “No;
nothing wrong. Never felt better. I’m just
wide awake. Go to bed and don’t lie there
listening for me. Wiggles and I are going to
prowl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drowsing dog whacked his tail sleepily
against the floor, at the sound of his name,
yawned elaborately, opened his eyes, and saw
the cap in his master’s hand. Whereupon he
forsook all idea of sleep and converted himself
into a canine battering ram, until finally
assured that he was invited to join in whatever
the cap might mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two went out into the warm, star-lit
night; and Pegeen stood looking after them
until the shadowy figures melted into the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it’s Her,” she said to herself,
with a sigh, “but he didn’t seem so awfully,
blue. I’m glad he took Wiggles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wiggles was glad too, exuberantly glad.
Night wandering was an unusual experience
for him. In the early evening, he curled up
close to his master or to the small girl who
shared his allegiance and no temptation was
strong enough to lure him beyond the sound of
their voices or the touch of their hands.
When they went off to bed, responsibility fell
weightily upon him. A watch dog had no
right to night roaming and Wiggles knew it.
So, though sometimes his yellow body quivered
with eagerness when distant night noises
called him and his sharp nose sniffled excitedly
at the scents that came to him on the night
breeze, he kept faith with the sleepers in the
shack and watched over them with unswerving
fidelity as only a yellow mongrel dog
knows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now he was out and away with a clear
conscience and with his master for companion,
and he made the most of the happy chance.
Such frantic following of fresh smelly trails!
Such wild yelping at stone walls where wood-chucks
lurked! Such mad pursuit of little
furry folk, going about their night business!
Such excited returns to his master and futile
efforts to tell him all about the things that, being
only a man, he could not see or smell or
hear!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larks, eh, Wiggles?” Archibald said
laughingly, as the dog dashed back to him
with the news of most prodigious occurrences
further along the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wiggles leaped up at him joyously, then,
lighting on all four feet, stiffened and listened
to something behind them. A moment later,
the man’s duller ears caught the sound of galloping
hoofs. He stepped out of the road,
wondering idly that so many riders should be
out; and, as a dozen men swept by him, he
peered curiously through the gloom. The
night veiled the men’s faces and they passed
too quickly for recognition; but as they went,
a laugh and an oath from one of them gave
him a clue. Lem Tollerton’s voice! It had
been loud enough and insistent enough at the
smithy that afternoon to fix itself in Archibald’s
memory; and as he heard it again a suspicion
leaped into his brain. What had
brought Lem Tollerton and his crew down the
Valley? Ezra? Conviction came on the
heels of the suspicion. Ezra, of course. Just
what the night riders meant to do with the
man, he did not know. Lem had talked of
tar and feathers; but men did not carry tar and
feathers on horseback. Whipping, probably.
Archibald remembered Mr. Neal’s story of
the Jew peddler and winced at the thought.
Perhaps Ezra deserved a thrashing; but there
was a slender chance that he was the wrong
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sudden tightening of the jaw that
meant action, Archibald turned from the road
and swung himself over the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Wiggles,” he called. There was
a little ring of excitement in his voice.
“Maybe we can beat them to it, by the short
cut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wiggles was willing—delighted. He did
not know just what the new game was and it
interfered with his hunting; but, since his master
wanted to run, run they would, and the
meadow turf was softer than the road and altogether
life had become gloriously eventful.
He raced along beside the running man, with
occasional side steps, when provocation
proved too strong, and scurrying haste to catch
up after each lapse. Together, the two came
to the wall bordering the Back Road, climbed
it and found themselves within sight of Ezra
Watts’ cottage, but, just as they dropped from
the wall, the same riders who had passed them
ten minutes before clattered by them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald stood still for a moment or two
to regain the breath he had lost in his dash
across fields. When he ran down the road,
the horsemen had already stopped before the
cottage and one of them was pounding on the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come out of that before we smoke you
out.” It was Lem Tollerton’s voice again and
the profanity with which he elaborated his
command was more eloquent than decent.
The riders were all yelling now, accusing,
cursing, threatening. Drunk, every one of
them—Archibald realized it with a sinking
of the heart. Reasoning with drunken men
was fruitless business and he was one man
against twelve. Ezra did not count. Still he
pelted on, with Wiggles at his heels. As he
joined the group before the cottage, the door
opened and Ezra appeared in the doorway.
His face was livid with fear, and the picture
he made in the light of the dark lantern which
one of the riders carried was not one to rouse
sympathy. If ever a criminal, face to face
with retribution, looked the part, the cringing
wretch in the doorway looked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’ye want?” he snarled, his little
ferret eyes searching this way and that for a
chance of escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You,” Lem Tollerton answered tersely.
He seized the shrinking figure, jerked it down
the steps, and handed it over to two men with
ropes in their hands. Then, stepping back
among the mounted men, he took a heavy
horsewhip from one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald waited no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, men, this sort of thing doesn’t go
in a civilized community,” he said. “You’d
better stop feeling and do some thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quiet voice was as cheerfully conversational
as though the stage had not been set for
melodrama; and the lean, nonchalant intruder
to whom the night had suddenly given birth
stood with his hands in his pockets and a half
smile on his lips; but there was a look in his
eyes that made the men nearest him glance apprehensively
at the pockets and back away.
Some of them pulled their hats low over their
eyes. One or two wheeled their horses
around, as though for flight; but Lem Tollerton
was made of sterner stuff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get along better if you’ll take your
own advice and do some thinking yourself,”
he blustered. “We don’t want to do you any
harm, Mr. Archibald, but this is our affair;
and, if you don’t want to get hurt, you’d better
not mix up in it. We’re out to give this d—d
fire-bug a dressing down that he’ll remember
and see him across the state line, and we’re
going to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has he done?” Archibald asked, still
cool, though his fighting blood was warming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done? You know well enough what he’s
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s your proof?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proof be damned. Get out of my way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tollerton raised his whip as though to enforce
his command and Archibald’s right hand
came swiftly out of his pocket. There was no
revolver in it; but as his clenched fist hit Lem
Tollerton’s chin, that hulking worthy dropped
as though he had been shot and lay still in the
path. Archibald stooped, caught the whip
from his hand, and backed against the cottage
wall, while Wiggles, a ridge of upstanding
hair along his back, his lips curled back angrily
from his sharp white teeth, a low ominous
growl sounding in his throat, crouched at
his master’s feet. Archibald had forgotten
Wiggles when he had figured that he would
be one against twelve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be fools, boys,” the man against the
wall pleaded. “I’ll promise to get Ezra out
of the State for good, to-night. Maybe he’s
guilty. Maybe he isn’t—but twelve to one
isn’t a man’s game, any way you look at it.
You’ll be glad you called it off, when morning
comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men wavered uncertainly. Several of
them made a threatening move forward.
Archibald clutched the whip in the middle,
with its heavy butt ready for action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a friend of yours, boys,” he said
grimly, “and I haven’t much use for Ezra;
but I believe in fair play. I can’t lay you all
out before you get me; but I’ll do all the
damage I can; and if you don’t beat the life
out of me, God’s my witness, I’ll drag every
mother’s son of you into court and send him
up, if it takes the rest of my life and my last
penny to do it. You’d better think it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, the men stood irresolute.
Then one of them dug his heels into his horse’s
flanks and galloped off down the road. The
others followed promptly, only the two dismounted
men lingering to look ruefully down
at Lem Tollerton’s prostrate figure. As they
hesitated, he groaned, put a hand to his head,
opened his eyes—and closed them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a pump behind the house, Nick,”
Archibald said. One of the men disappeared
and came back with a gourd full of water
which he dashed in Tollerton’s face. The
treatment worked well. Lem sat up, looked
around him, and staggered groggily to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what the—” he began; but his
friends took him by the arms, led him to his
horse and helped him to mount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing doing, Lem,” Nick Bullard said
soothingly. “Mr. Archibald’s going to take
Watts out of the State to-night. That’s good
enough. Let’s fade away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Limp, dazed, reeling in his saddle, but sober,
Lem Tollerton looked at the man who still
stood on the defensive, his back to the wall and
his dog at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s some little knockout of yours,” he
said with a sheepish grin in which there was
no malice. “Don’t tell <span class='it'>me</span> you was trained
for a painter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out a hand as he spoke and Archibald,
laughing, met the hand half way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a useful thing to have a knockout in
one’s fist,” he said genially. “Come over to
the shack some evening and I’ll teach it to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the last of the riders had disappeared
in the darkness, he turned to Ezra who
cowered beside him, still shaking with fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Ezra, the whipping didn’t come
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of himself there was contempt
mixed with the kindness in his voice. “But
you heard what I said about your leaving the
State?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh,” grunted Ezra. Neither relief nor
gratitude could move him to civility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That goes; but I’m willing to give you
what money you’ll need for a month or two.
Fifty dollars ought to see you through; and
I’m ready to hand it over when I’ve put you
on a train at Pittsfield; but if ever you show
your face here again, the boys may do as they
please with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped in astonishment; for the mention
of the money had evidently wakened no interest
and Ezra appeared to be listening not
to him but to some sound from within the
house. As Archibald leaned forward to see
him more closely, he moved hurriedly toward
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in here,” he said. “I want to show
you something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald stepped into the house and waited
while Ezra scratched a match on the wall and
lighted a candle. The flickering tongue of
flame left most of the room in darkness; but
it threw its light upon a man who lay upon the
bed—a man in even worse case than Ezra’s
when Archibald had first found his way into
the squalid little house—a bleared, bloated,
dirty, unkempt hulk of a man who lay with
closed eyes and breathed in short strangling
gasps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been like that ever since I found him
last night,” Ezra said. “I was going for you
anyway in the morning. Seemed as if something
had orter be done and I didn’t know
what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you call Dr. Fullerton?”
Archibald asked wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know how folks feel about the
barn burnings and I didn’t know how Doc’d
see his duty; but I thought you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ezra looked back at the doors and windows
and moved nearer to Archibald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Mike O’Neill,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name meant nothing to Archibald and
his face showed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The kid’s father,” Ezra explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegeen’s father?” The man’s tone was
amazed, unbelieving, protesting; but Ezra
nodded his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh huh. He’s been hanging around ever
since spring. Crazy as a loon. Stayed in that
old woodchopper’s hut on Bald Pate, daytimes,
and went skulking around nights, stealing
enough to live on and burning a barn now
and then just for fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure?” Archibald’s heart cried
out against the hideous thing. Peg’s father
the barn burner, the petty thief, the miserable,
sodden wreck that lay there on the dirty bed!
It was unthinkable and yet Ezra’s voice and
manner carried conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. I’m sure,” he was saying.
“I’ve known ever since the Shaker fire. I’d
suspicioned there was somebody around that
nobody knew about; and one night I’d run
into a man when I happened to be coming out
of Miss Moran’s chicken house; but I didn’t
see him rightly. I was sort of busy not being
seen myself. Then, the night the Shaker barn
burned, I caught him running away down the
road just after the fire broke out. I knew him
the minute I clapped eyes on him. ’Twus
bright moonlight, you know. He ducked into
the woods; but I trailed him up Bald Pate and
then I come home and figgered things out.
’Twus plain as the nose on yer face that he’d
been doing the barn burning; and, first off, I
thought I’d tell folks and sort of clear things
up for myself. But then I got to thinking
about the kid and how bad she’d feel and
there wuzn’t anybody to be upset be-cuz <span class='it'>I</span> was
a fire-bug and I didn’t give a damn what folks
believed about me; so I just decided to keep
things to myself. I went up and called turkey
to O’Neill, though—told the crazy fool that
I knew all about what he’d been doing and
that I could have him hanged but that I
wouldn’t if he’d let up on the barn business.
I didn’t care how much he stole. He seemed
to sense what I meant and blubbered around
and said he wouldn’t light any more fires, only
they looked so pretty when they burned and
St. Michael had told him to come back here
and burn all the barns, and Michael was his
special saint so he didn’t want to contrary him.
I told him I’d fix it up with Michael and then
he quieted down and I come away. Looked
as if he wasn’t too batty to keep a promise,
until last night. Then Tibbits’ barn went up;
and, as I wuz sneaking along through the
woods so as nobody’d see me and think I’d
been out doing the burning, I stumbled over
this here bundle of rags. Just the way he is
now, he wuz. I had a time getting him down
here and then I didn’t know what to do next;
but I figgered I’d better go and git you, in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long speech for Ezra. Never, to
his own knowledge, had he strung so many
words together at one time; and he stumbled
through the story with a hang-dog air as
though mortally ashamed to shift his vicious
reputation to other shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald listened with knitted brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Peg!” he said softly, under his
breath. “Poor little Peg!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ezra shifted uneasily from one foot to the
other and back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the good of her knowing?” he
asked gruffly. Archibald looked at him in
blank surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, she’ll have to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she won’t,” Ezra snapped it out in his
most disagreeable manner. “He’s going to
die. If he don’t, he’s too crazy to be left
running around free. If he dies, you and
Doc can bury him on the quiet; and, if he
lives, you can chuck him into the asylum. She
couldn’t do anything for him, if she knew.
What’s the use bothering her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you—” Archibald began in bewilderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’d be moving along sometime, anyway.
What’d I stay for? And what’d I
care if they think they run me out? Kind of
tickles me to have ’em think I burned their
barns and stole ’em blind. No use white-washing
me. It wouldn’t stick. I’ll light
out; and then you can tell the kid some sort of
fairy story that’ll let her down easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cleared his throat, sniffed unpleasantly,
and drew his sleeve across his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s better than most,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald looked into the dirty, repulsive
face and humbled himself before the thing
he saw in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There <span class='it'>was</span> a scrap of decent soul hidden
deep down in Ezra Watts, as the Smiling Lady
had said, and Peg had brought it to the surface.
Here was a man capable of love and
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a very good sort, Ezra,” Archibald
said slowly. “I’d like to shake hands
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out a friendly hand and Ezra
clasped it in a furtive, embarrassed fashion,
but with a look of satisfaction on his ugly
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stood up to ’em fine.” It was his first
word of appreciation, and it came haltingly.
“I went out becuz I didn’t want ’em to come
in here and find him; but things looked sort
of bad for me until you come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stood up to them better than I did,
man.” Archibald’s voice was husky. Souls
were surprising things. “It took more courage
to face another man’s punishment than to
fight another man’s battle. Now I’ll go for
Dr. Fullerton. When he comes, we’ll decide
what to do about Pegeen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Neill’s dying,” the doctor said, as he
stood by Michael’s bed, an hour later. “You
must bring Peg. It will be better for her to
know that he is dead than to be always imagining
he’s alone and in trouble. And, in fairness
to Ezra, we ought to tell the whole
truth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped and stood thinking for a moment,
then shook his head decisively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; that’s wrong. It’s fairer to Ezra
to let him do the generous thing for love of
Peg. It’d be a pity to let his first fine sentiment
be still-born. Yes; on the whole, I
believe we’d better let him go with his
bad reputation intact. God bless him for
a thieving, big-hearted, low-down scallawag!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was arranged. The doctor drove
to Pittsfield with Ezra and put him on the
midnight train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get off when you feel like it,” he said,
“and let Archibald or me hear from you if
you’re in a hole so tight that you can’t squirm
out of it. Hang it all, I’m actually glad I
saved your life, Ezra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ezra made no reply. His hour of expansiveness
had passed and he had sunk back into
his sullen quiet; but there were fifty dollars
in cash and a check for five hundred more in
his pocket; and somewhere back in his mind
was an idea of raising chickens instead of
stealing them. He had always liked chickens
and now that he was a capitalist, he could
indulge his fancies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the doctor reached the cottage on the
Back Road once more, Archibald borrowed
the car and went for Pegeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to hurry,” Doctor Fullerton
said, after a moment’s examination of the man
on the bed who had been given some semblance
of cleanliness and order, and Archibald
hurried. A half hour later he was back
again, with a white-faced, great-eyed child
who ran past the doctor and dropped on her
knees beside the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy!” she cried; and the love and yearning
in her voice made the two men behind her
bite their lips and look angry as men will
when their hearts are touched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pleading voice found its way, somehow,
to the fog-bound brain and Michael
O’Neill’s soul turned back from its long journey,
to look through sane eyes, into the tender
child face, framed in wind-blown, black curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Pegeen,” he whispered feebly.
“My little Peggy, of the curls!— But ’twas
your mother I made the name for, Mary of
the Curls! You’ve a look of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes that had been blue as Pegeen’s
own, before the drink blurred them, closed
and the lips that had, on some far-off day,
wooed Mary of the Curls, settled into strange
stillness, and Archibald, kneeling beside Peg,
put his arm around her, drew her close and
let her cry; while, stealing in from the outer
dark, a lonely and forgotten yellow pup
snuggled up to the sobbing child and nuzzled
a cold wet nose into her hand.</p>

<h1 id='t7213'>XIII</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen carried a sore heart for many
a day after Michael O’Neill’s funeral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wasn’t a very good father,” she said
pitifully to Archibald, “and he wasn’t very
good to Mother, but ’twas the drink that did
it; and I think the drink’s just a sickness, don’t
you? Mother had a picture of him, a little
picture that she wore in a locket. He was
young in it; and he looked so brave and glad
and lovery. I like to think of him that way—but
I loved him, even after he was—sick.
It’s a poor time to stop loving folks when
they’re bad, isn’t it? That’s when they
need it the very most, and Daddy loved back
real hard when he was sober.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In comforting her, Archibald dulled the
edge of his own heartache; and the two
neighbored faithfully, even enthusiastically.
Sometimes they drove. More often they
rode; and, though Pegeen was not quite her
old gay self, the visits were usually high-hearted
adventures. Everything one did with
Peg was more or less of an adventure. There
was something about her that lent spice to the
most prosaic of expeditions and Archibald
found himself looking at the Valley through
her eyes and loving it. He had laughed
skeptically when the Smiling Lady had said
that there were no uninteresting people,
that there were only people one didn’t get
at; but he began to believe that she had been
right. There were delightful folk in the
Valley and there were queer folk; but, delightful
or queer, none of them bored him;
and, when he remembered how often and how
intolerably he had been bored in the old days,
he was forced to believe that the difference
was in him, not in the people around him.
After all, types were much the same. He
could cap every character in the Valley with
a corresponding one in New York. Externals
were different; but the inner men and women
were the same. So the change must be in
himself; but he doubted whether, thrown on
his own resources, he could walk the new road
even now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Pegeen,” he said to himself. “She’s
a universal solvent. If I had neighbored
without her, I’d never have known these people
as I know them now. She coaxes the best
of every one out into the open where I can
see it; and, after that the worst of him can’t
fool me. Even the worst of him doesn’t look
bad to me when I see it through Peg’s eyes.
Funny, perhaps, or pitiful, or sad, but not bad.
Yes; it’s Pegeen. She’s made me free of <span class='it'>her</span>
Valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of which was modest and, in a degree,
true; but, as a matter of fact, the Valley, having
first accepted him on Pegeen’s recommendation,
and looked him over with the tolerance
she inspired, liked him for himself and
showed him its friendly side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thee has a pleasant way with thee, Son,”
Eldress Martha of the Shakers said to him
when he had sat on one of the straight-backed,
rush-bottomed chairs in her stiff, spotless sitting-room,
for an hour one summer afternoon,
holding high converse with the little old lady
whose spirit was so much bigger and stronger
than her body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could wish thee were with us and at
peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking lately that perhaps I’m
on the road to peace, Eldress Martha,” he
said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled. When she smiled, the great
gray eyes that glowed so wonderfully in her
thin white face melted into sweetness and the
hint of fanaticism died out of her look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roads are many, Son, but there are
sign posts along all,” she said. “It is easy to
know whether one is traveling toward the
right goal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are brand new kittens,” announced
Pegeen skipping joyously into the quiet shaded
room and bringing a gust of the sunshiny outdoor
world with her, “and the jam is heavenly
this year, Eldress Martha. I tried three
kinds, and I saw Sister Jane take honey out of
the hives,—only I didn’t see it as close as I
wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped down on the floor at the Eldress’
feet and leaned her head against the
gray clad knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why bees should want to sting
me.” Her voice held a note of injury. “But
they do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eldress Martha laughed. Her laugh was
even better than her smile, a thing surpassingly
girlish, and the tenderness in her face,
as she laid her hand lightly on the child’s head
and smoothed the shining black hair, gave
Archibald a sudden twinge of heartache. It
must be very lonely sometimes, on the spiritual
heights, and this dear woman had walked
there so long. He wondered whether she
ever looked back to some far-away time of
youth and counted the cost of the peace she
had now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Pegeen was contented to take Eldress
Martha’s human side without question. She
had never been over-awed by Shaker asceticism.
That was perhaps the reason why the
sisters adored her. They were such simple,
friendly folk in spite of their rules and visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Paul came to the garden,” Pegeen
rubbed her cheek softly against the caressing
hand, as she spoke, “and he told me a spandy
new poem,—a lovely one. He’d met it coming
down through the orchard and it isn’t a
speck religious,—just summery and sweet and
all about butterflies and birds and clouds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thee doesn’t call <span class='it'>that</span> ‘religious’?”
asked Eldress Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen recognized the gentle reproof with
a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why of course it is, when you stop to think
about it—praising God and all his works and
psalmy things like that,—but I meant it
wasn’t anything you’d sing in church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Paul meets many poems that are
not for church Worship.” The Eldress spoke
quietly but a shadow of anxiety clouded the
serenity of her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I wonder if the beauty of this
world is not too much in his mind and heart,”
she added. “Thee sees, child, it is good to
love the beautiful things God has made; but
always one must look through them to the
Eternal Beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you don’t always have to say it,”
Pegeen said comfortably. “I believe that being
chuckfull of love for anything is worshiping
God, even if you don’t think about Him
at all when you’re doing it. I just adore St.
Francis. Miss Moran’s Ellen told me about
him. She likes St. Anthony best because he
finds things for her when she’s lost them, but
I think St. Francis was a perfect old darling.
He did love everything so hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he is a Popish Saint, child.” There
was rebuke in the Eldress’ voice, but Pegeen
looked up at her serenely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet the birds and beasts didn’t care
<span class='it'>what</span> church he belonged to,” she said, and
Eldress Martha laughed once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thee has small respect for creeds, Peggy,”
she said, “but thee has a great heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sisters crowded doors and windows to
wave good-by as Pegeen and Archibald rode
away down the street and the small girl turned
to throw kisses to them until a bend of the road
hid the East Family buildings from view.
Then she settled back into her saddle to talk
things over. They always talked a neighboring
visit over. That was one of the best parts
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t they the sweetest things?” she said
beamingly. “I just wish I could give every
single one of them a nice little baby of her
own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t it rather shake up the community?”
he asked gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen considered the proposition. “Well,
I suppose it would a little—not having marrying
and giving in marriage in their religion
you know—like Heaven—but shaking up
wouldn’t hurt them, and I think it’s dreadful
for so many perfectly darling women to miss
having babies—and it’s a shame for the babies
too because somebody else that isn’t half as
nice will have to take them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s the lonesomest thing to go on
cooking and sweeping and dusting and making
jam and nobody to do it for but each other
and God. Just think of the fun all those old
ladies could have if the top floor was plumb
full of babies growing up into nice Shakers.
I guess it’d have to be grandbabies but then
if they had grandbabies they’d have had babies
sometime so that would be all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told Sister Jane how I felt about it
She’s the pretty one with pink cheeks that
tends the bees,—and she said they couldn’t
very well have babies of their own, but that
she could find it in her heart to wish they had
a top floor of real cuddly orphan babies. She
loves to cuddle things. That’s one reason
why we’re such great friends; and, do you
know, she’s got <span class='it'>twelve</span> dresses all as good as
can be. They all have to be gray but there
aren’t any two the same shade and she gets
a little change that way. I do love Sister
Jane. She and I have splendid times together
and she sort of spills over to me, when she
isn’t feeling so awfully religious. When we
went to see the kittens, after Brother Paul
said his poem to us, she told me the Eldress
didn’t like his writing poetry that wasn’t religious,
and spending so much time out in the
fields and woods instead of working when he’s
the strongest, youngest man in the family.
They were going to call him up about it; but
Eldress Martha said ‘no’ she’d attend to the
matter, and that settled it. I tell you when
Eldress Martha says ‘no’ the Elders just pick
up their coat tails and go away on their tippy
toes. But Sister Jane says she thinks Eldress
Martha’s worried about Brother Paul herself.
She’s terribly fond of him and he isn’t
very frequent in prayer lately and he doesn’t
testify at all—but he certainly does write
scrumptious poetry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that you said about his meeting
a poem in the orchard?” Archibald asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s the way the Shakers always
talk about their poetry. Lots of them write
hymns. Eldress Martha writes lovely ones—and
they always say they met them. They
think the Lord gives them the poetry ready
made, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Direct inspiration: I see—Poor Brother
Paul with his world beauty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald looked as if he too were worried
about the young poet. Little by little he was
learning that the Happy Valley teemed with
drama. This neighboring with Pegeen was
interesting, extraordinarily interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day by day he grew more dependent upon
this child’s companionship. Whether he
rode or tramped or loafed or gardened or
neighbored, he wanted her near. Even when,
he painted, she usually sat beside him dreaming
or busy with some quiet work but always
ready with smiles and eager interest if he
looked from his canvas to her face or spoke to
her; and it was not possible to feel that the
world was an altogether disappointing and
lonely place when one had such a comrade.
Wiggles, too, did his dog best in the line of
companion plays and a yellow dog’s best of
worship is a thing to warm the cockles of even
the heaviest heart. There was a curious likeness
between the child’s deep blue Irish eyes
and the pup’s liquid brown eyes, during those
long August days. Passionate devotion welling
up from child heart and dog heart made
the eyes kin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little garden in front of the shack was
ablaze with August glory now and Pegeen’s
face, as she bent over the flowers or knelt beside
the borders making war on weeds, was a
pleasant thing to see; but a sadness came into
it, whenever she looked at the clumps of perennials
striving lustily in preparation for another
year. Archibald had said that he would come
back to watch them bloom; but he had said
that before Richard Meredith’s coming, and
back in the darkest pigeonhole of Pegeen’s
mind was a suspicion that she and Wiggles
and Spunky and Mrs. Benderby and the horses
and the neighbors and the garden all added
together would never be able to make him
happy, with Nora Moran away. She would
not admit to herself in the daytime that the
suspicion was there; but sometimes when she
happened to waken in the night, she would
take it out and cry over it a little, very quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Archibald rode often to the Shaker
village where Eldress Martha was in her element
with work and responsibility, pouring
upon her torrent-wise. Even on her busiest
days she had time for Archibald. The friendship
between the two, whose lives had run in
grooves so different, was a real thing and the
man went away from his hours with the tender-hearted,
steel-willed old woman with an
uplift of spirit. After all the needs of brave
souls were much the same. Whether it was
Eldress Martha with her religious faith and
her life of the spirit or Dr. Fullerton with his
agnosticism and bluff materialism, the test of
the soul was its sincerity and courage. The
doctor had put it in a nutshell, the night he
had fought for Ezra Watt’s life and won.
Playing the game was the thing. To choose
a game in which one believes there was good
and to play it for all there was in it—that was
the life worth living. If love and laughter
walked with the player, so much the better.
If not,—still there was the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the more Archibald went the Valley
ways, the more he realized that, in one form or
another, neighboring was the great game.—There
in the valley—out beyond—wherever
men and women worked and hoped and loved
and suffered, there was call for players stout
of heart, strong of will, great of soul, wise of
brain. Once when a baby’s hand had curled
round his finger, he had said to himself that
neighboring was not the last word, that a man’s
own meant more; but, during those Summer
days when Pegeen and he went up and down
the Valley, knocking at the doors of hearts and
lives, he came to realize dimly that a man’s
own reaches out beyond the doors of his home
and that if he follows it to the soul heights
and the love limits, he will find himself, walking
there with the brotherhood of Man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ginsy Shalloway, who, by virtue of “sewing
around,” had gained a shrewd knowledge
of human nature and was prone to sharp criticism,
voiced the general verdict when she admitted
that “the artist man’s friendliness rang
true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems as if he honestly liked folks and was
real set on their liking him,” she said, when
the matter came up for discussion at the
ladies’ aid society. “I don’t know as I ever
saw a city fellow with as few trimmings.
He’s pleased as can be when he gets an invite
to dinner and he eats so hearty, you’d think
he didn’t get the right kind of victuals at
home, if you didn’t know Peg. He was eating
dinner up at Nelsons’ the other day when
that big storm came up so sudden; and, if he
didn’t pull off his coat and go out into the
hay field with Martin and help to hustle the
hay in. Real good help he was too, Martin
says—stronger than you’d think and quick as
a cat. And then the boys got to wrestling out
in the barn; and if he didn’t lay them all out
on their backs, as easy as rolling off a log.
They were some surprised and ashamed; but
he said he’d taken lessons of a Japanee and
that the Japs beat the world for wrestling and
that, if the boys would like to learn, he’d teach
them all the tricks he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So now he’s got a sort of class down in an
empty loft at Jim Neal’s and a lot of the boys
go there twice a week. Mis’ Dawes says their
Jim’s plumb crazy about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy wasn’t the only boy who was crazy
about the class in the barn loft. One by one
they came trooping in, shyly and awkwardly
at first; but soon with glad confidence
and unbounded enthusiasm. Lem Tollerton
dropped in one evening to learn the knock-out
that had laid him low, and, in his wake, the
young men of the Valley found their way
to the loft. Archibald added gloves and foils
to his equipment; and within a few weeks,
wrestling, boxing, fencing and jiu-jitsu were
epidemic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It beats all,” Martin Nelson, the father of
four husky lads, confided to Mr. Colby.
“My boys are poking and pounding each other
all over the place, the minute they ain’t at
work; but I don’t know as I ever saw them so
good-natured. Seems as if they thought being
knocked endways was a treat and they’re
always and everlastingly talking about playing
fair and not taking advantage and not losing
temper and not poking here or punching
there. I don’t know but what teaching them
to fight’s going to take the fighting out of
them. Anyway they ain’t hanging around
the stores every evening cooking up trouble.
They do say Lem Tollerton and his crowd are
cutting out booze, because it gets at them and
spoils their fighting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and again, one of the older men, drawn
by curiosity, came to the class to look on. He
seldom went away without having a bout with
the gloves or a wrestling lesson and he usually
came again. The crowd soon outgrew its
quarters and Archibald went to Dr. Fullerton
with a plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Valley needs a men’s and boys’ club,”
he said. “Where can we have it and how will
we run it? You know this community better
than I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so popular with it, when it’s
healthy,” the doctor said dryly. “You’re
working as hard to make yourself solid as
if you were running for office. Pity not to
stand for something, with the pull you’ve
got.” He dropped his banter and laid a
friendly hand on the younger man’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bully work, man. You’re doing
more to humanize the Valley than the doves
of peace could if they came in flocks. Nothing
like beating an idea of honest sport into
a fellow’s head for making a decent citizen
of him. When he’s grasped the idea that
there are some things no fellow can do, he’s
got something to work on. I’m inclined to
think that boxing will grip a boy’s soul when
Sunday school fails. Now about this club,
How much money will it take?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll put up the money.” Dr. Fullerton
shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you won’t. That would be a mistake.
Buy or rent a place if you want to fix it up;
but organize a regular club and put some of
your toughest specimens in as officers. Responsibility’s
most as good for a fellow as boxing.
Let the members pay the running expenses
out of the dues. They’ll think more
of the club if they have to do some hustling to
keep it going. There’s that old house of
Rankins’. It’s been empty ever since the old
man died. Nephew it was left to lives out in
Seattle. It’s a whaling big place, but you
wouldn’t need to use it all and I’ve a notion
you could get it for a song.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald told Pegeen about the club that
night. She was all interest and encouragement;
but there was a hint of mental reservation
in her approval, and the man noticed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Peg, out with it!” he commanded.
“What’s wrong with the scheme?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She blushed at discovery and hesitated, then
spoke her thought frankly, as she always did
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t anything wrong with it. It’s
splendid of you to do it and folks will be perfectly
crazy about it—only I was just thinkink
how it’s most always the men and the boys
that get things done for them. I s’pose it’s
because they won’t be good all by themselves
the way women and girls will; but I don’t
think that’s exactly fair, do you? It’s like
giving prizes to the worst spellers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald looked at her with a puzzled
frown between his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Peg,” he began; then stopped and
thought the proposition over. Suddenly,
something that the Smiling Lady had once
said to him came back to him and his face
cleared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegeen, I’m a fool—just a plain, block-headed
fool. This Valley doesn’t need a
men’s and boys’ club. It needs a neighborhood
house and you are going to give it one.
There can be a men’s club and a boys’ club
and a women’s club and a girls’ club, just for
the fun of the thing; but there’ll be a big get-together
club that will take all the others in.
How’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen’s face was his answer. It was one
rapture from brow to chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be perfectly wonderful,” she said
happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a shadow drifted across the rapture
and she sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” questioned the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing. I was just thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thinking what?” he insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked very uncomfortable, wriggled
uneasily in her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Miss Moran,” she said, at last. “She
was always crazy to have a club, here in the
Valley—a neighborhood house she called it
just like you did. She used to talk and talk
and plan and plan; but she didn’t have money
enough. I was just thinking how lovely it
would have been if—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was on the borderland of unspoken
things and afraid to go further; but Archibald
opened her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, Peg,” he said abruptly. “You
mustn’t make any mistake about my feeling
for Miss Moran. I’m head over heels in love
with her. You’re too clever not to know that
and I don’t mind your knowing it; but, because
I can’t marry her, is no reason why you
and I shouldn’t talk about her exactly as we
always did. If she’d like this club, there’s
one more big reason for putting it across, and
the more she helps with it, the better I’ll be
satisfied; only you are giving the club house
to the Valley. Just remember that. Now
we’ll go and talk the thing over with Miss
Moran.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His frankness cleared the air for himself
as well as for the child; and when they found
the Smiling Lady on her veranda and told her
about the plan, the vague chill that had seemed
to envelop her melted quite away before their
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid!” she cried eagerly. “Splendid!
How you <span class='it'>have</span> come on with your neighboring,
Mr. Archibald! I prophesied you’d
make something of him, Peggy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a ring of pride in the jesting
voice, a glow of pride in the smiling face.
Richard Meredith, watching her from the
hammock, noticed both. She was glad for
the Valley, but there was more gladness beyond
that; gladness and pride and—yes, there
was tenderness too. It meant much to her that
her people were to have their neighborhood
house; but it meant even more to her that this
one man was to give it to them, that they had
found their way to his heart, and that he was
finding his way to theirs. Meredith’s face
gave no sign of anything save civil interest;
but he drew back a little further into the
shadow of the vines that clambered over the
veranda trellis, and watched the girl and the
man who leaned toward each other in the
white moonlight, talking eagerly and with an
intimate understanding that was new to him
but prehistoric to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They altogether forgot him, when they went
into the lamp-lighted room to figure on
changes in the club house; but, as he sat there
in the shadow, feeling oddly old and tired, a
little figure slipped out through the French
windows and tucked herself cozily into the
hammock beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which do you think would be nicer to
have—a piano or a phonograph?” Pegeen
asked confidentially, gathering him, as a matter
of course, into intimacy of discussion and
planning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man smiled in the dusk. She was so
small and sweet and friendly and—though
that he could not know—so sure he needed
seeing to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you both, for your neighborhood
house, Pegeen,” he said—but added quickly,
“if Mr. Archibald doesn’t object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he’d be <span class='it'>glad</span>,” she insisted stoutly,
though back in her own mind there was a
doubt. “That’s perfectly sweet of you. Oh,
dear, it does seem as if God must have been
working on that club for years and years.
Everything’s going so beautifully. Only
Deacon Ransom’ll have a fit about the billiard
table. He won’t fit hard enough to keep him
away though, and Miss Moran says he’s just
got to let Sally come. I wish she’d get a beau
down there and run off with him. Honestly
I do. I’d help—if he’s nice. Do you know,
I think a piano and a phonograph’s an awful
lot for you to give. I wouldn’t want anything
but the phonograph, but you see the
mothers are so proud if their daughters can
play some pieces and when there’s an entertainment,
they always want the girls to show
off; so it seems as if we really did need a piano.
I’m going to tell everybody that you thought
it up all by yourself, and Miss Moran didn’t
have a thing to do with it. I shouldn’t wonder
if you’d think of lots of things like that
after a while. It isn’t a bit hard, after you
once get started—not if anybody’s nice inside,
like you. I guess city folks have to get new
glasses to see country folks right, and some of
them don’t ever bother to do it; but the awfully
nice ones, like you and Miss Moran and
Mr. Archibald, do. And then, after they put
on the new glasses, they see so many kind
things to do that they work like the very old
Scratch to catch up with themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meredith pulled the child’s head down
against his shoulder and rumpled the thick
curls with a gentle hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s late for me to be changing glasses or
ways, Peg,” he said softly; and his voice
matched the gray of his hair. “Do you think
I could ever catch up with myself, if I didn’t
have Miss Moran to help me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy reached up and gave the hand on her
hair a loving little pat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’d be as easy as can be for you,”
she assured him. “If you ever begin neighboring—in
earnest, you know—I bet you’ll
be perfectly splendid at it. Of course it’d be
lovely to have Miss Moran help—but she
wouldn’t need to. She started Mr. Archibald,
but look at him now! I get jealous of
the neighbors sometimes just for a minute; and
he’s done most of it all by himself. Miss
Moran hasn’t helped him atall, since you
came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve an idea she has kept right on helping
him—in a way,” the man said slowly,—“and
then he’s had you to see to him, Pegeen.”</p>

<h1 id='t7903'>XIV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>A tidal wave of excitement rolled
through the Valley when news of the
Neighborhood Club was noised about; and,
when, on the evening of September fourth, the
house was thrown open to the public, only the
bedridden stayed away. The doors were open
at seven o’clock; and at eight, the house was
full to the eaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re perfectly wild about it,” Pegeen
confided happily to Archibald as she passed
him in the hall. “Every blessed soul’s doing
something—even Deacon Ransom. He
was as snippy as could be, when he came; and
he said the billard table was an invitation to
sin, but now he’s out in the bowling alley in
his shirt sleeves, beating Mr. Nelson all to
pieces and as proud as Mr. Neal’s turkey gobbler
because he can do it. And Sallie Ransom
is sitting out on the side steps with Joe
Trevor. I sort of think he’s courting. And
Mrs. Neal’s dancing with Dr. Fullerton.
You ought to see her. She’s as light on her
feet as if she didn’t weigh more’n I do. And
Mr. Colby is playing checkers with Mr. Frisbie.
Mrs. Frisbie thinks it’s worldly for a
minister. And Mr. Meredith is teaching
some of the boys billiards and Miss Moran is
cutting cake. We’re going to have refreshments
pretty soon, because the children have
to go home early and it’s their club just as
much as the old folks’, isn’t it? They ought
to grow up into splendid neighbors, getting
such a lovely start here. It’s the very best
time I ever had, Mr. Archibald. It is really.”
She flew on down the hall and Archibald
found his way to the kitchen, where the Smiling
Lady with a corps of willing helpers was
making ready to feed the crowd. She was
tired but radiant, and she waved a sticky knife
at him as he appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a success. It’s a furor,” she called
gaily. “Everybody wants to join.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crossed the room and stood watching
her as she worked. They had been much
together, in the weeks of preparation for this
night, sharing plans and hopes and dreams,
working, side by side, for the good of the
neighbors they loved, for her own people
whom he had made his own people too. It
had been sweet, perilously sweet. There had
been times when the words he must not say
had trembled on his lips, times when he had
felt a blessed surety that the closeness meant as
much to her as to him; but he had held fast
to his idea of honor. He liked Richard
Meredith. The older man had won his
friendship against all the heavy odds. There
was something about him in which one believed,
something behind the outward reserve
that gripped and held. He so confidently expected
decency that in his quiet there was a
compelling force. One did not fail men like
Meredith—nor women like the Smiling Lady;
and so he had fought hard and kept faith with
both of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was so dear—so unspeakably dear.
His heart ached with its desire as he looked
down at her; and, glancing up, as she sent one
of her helpers away with a laden tray she surprised
the desperate longing in his eyes. An
answer leaped into her own face. Eyes, lips,
cheeks, were flooded with it. For an instant,
they stood so, alone in the crowd. Then as
swiftly as it had come, the revelation faded
from the girl’s face. Only the flush lingered
as she turned to her work again; but there was
a curious little thrill in her voice when she
tried to greet Jerry and Rosy Johnston’s demand
for chocolate cake, with her usual light
gaiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you with three pieces of cake apiece
tucked away inside of you this minute!” she
protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No toklate,” Jerry assured her solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No toklate,” echoed Rosy, with an accent
of reproach in her solemnity. The Smiling
Lady swept the two into her arms and kissed
both sticky faces with surprising fervor. The
twins endured it. They even hugged her
warmly, though hastily; but they did not, for
a moment, lose sight of the main issue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Now</span> toklate!” they chorused hopefully, as
they emerged from the embrace; and, laughing,
pink cheeked, shining eyed, she cut them
huge slices of chocolate cake and sent them
on their way, smeared, gorged, but rejoicing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all wrong,” she acknowledged shamefacedly.
“They’ll be sick, I suppose; but;
they did want it so dreadfully. I couldn’t
say ‘no.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, realizing the recklessness of admitting
weakness in the face of great longing, she
dropped the cake knife and fled to the pantry,
leaving Archibald exultant but tempest-tossed.
He was sure now, absolutely sure. She loved
him, not Meredith. Her face had said it, beyond
shadow of doubt, in the moment when
her guard was down. His heart sang for
gladness—and yet he had no right to be glad.
It would have been better if the unhappiness
could all have been his. That she loved him
would make no difference in the outcome of
things. She would put away the love and
keep her word to the man she had promised to
marry. He was sure of that and though the
sacrifice of two lives for one might be all
wrong, though it might not be for the ultimate
happiness of even the one, he knew that he
would only hurt her, not shake her resolve,
if he should fight for his own. And then
there was Meredith. Meredith and he were
friends now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who could not have <span class='it'>his</span> chocolate
cake turned and went out through the kitchen
door into the friendly, sheltering dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was ablaze with lights. Through
the open windows came a stream of sound,
laughter, chatter of voices, the click of billiard
balls, the clatter of dishes, the music of the
phonograph, the shuffle and tap of dancing
feet. The Valley was neighboring happily,
whole-heartedly, as it never had neighbored
before; but, out in the night, beyond reach of
the far-flung light, the man who had brought
the thing about leaned his arms upon the top
rail of a fence, hid his face against them and
fought hard against old enemies, against bitterness
and discouragement and a loneliness
of which he had almost lost the trick, in
months of living among neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an autumnal chill in the air.
The quiet stars looked down frostily from infinite
heights. All the warm, companioning
summer had slipped away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald straightened his shoulders and
moved slowly toward the house. He had
come to the end of summer’s trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were two figures on the side door
steps and Archibald caught a few words in a
man’s voice. He veered away hastily, smiling
a little, as he went toward the front door.
Joe Trevor was unquestionably “courting”!
To be alone with the one girl and to have the
right to speak!—Lucky Joe!—even though
Deacon Ransom was in the offing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long after midnight, before festivities
flagged and the older folk began to talk
of homegoing; but Archibald and Nora
Moran did not come within speaking distance
again, until the final ebbing surge of the crowd
flung them together in the big assembly room
on the main floor. Good-bys had begun and
the two stood side by side, shaking the hands
of crowding neighbors and smiling into the
friendly faces. Suddenly a boy’s voice
shouted “Three cheers for Mr. Archibald!”
The homegoers turned back and gave the
cheers with a will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speech! Speech!” Dr. Fullerton called.
The cry was taken up and echoed through the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald’s face reddened but there was a
fine glow of happiness in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m no talker, friends,” he said. His
voice shook a little as he spoke. “I’m afraid
I couldn’t even paint what I feel. It’s the
sort of thing there’s no way of telling; but
there’s one thing I do want to say. The
Valley has given me more than I ever can pay;
and, if you like Neighborhood House, I’m
very happy; for I’ve had a hand in it. Miss
Moran and Mr. Meredith and Dr. Fullerton
and I have worked together to make the thing
possible; but, though Miss Moran started me
on the right track, it was Peggy O’Neill who
taught me to neighbor. Neighborhood House
came out of Pegeen’s heart. If you must
thank somebody, thank her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegeen! Pegeen! Peggy! Peg!” The
whole crowd was calling—men, boys, women,
girls—calling for Pegeen. Out on the stairs,
where, with Richard Meredith, she had been
caught in the crush, the small girl clung to the
baluster, sobbing with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Peg. They want you.” Meredith
lifted her in his arms, carried her down the
steps and through the close pressing throng to
where Archibald and the Smiling Lady stood,
and set her on a chair beside them. Standing
so, she could look over the crowd and be seen
by all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peg! Peg! Peg!” The greeting came
with a roar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen stood, smiling, trembling, her sensitive
child face all a-quiver with feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say something to them, Peg,” Archibald
urged. She threw out her arms in a swift, inclusive
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I love you all so much!” she cried, in
a choked little voice. “I love every single
blessed one of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubting it. Her face told
it even more convincingly than her voice.
She loved them all—and they knew it. No
matter whom she happened to be seeing to, she
was the Valley’s Pegeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three cheers for Peg!” Jimmy Dawes
whooped shrilly, and the crowd responded
with deafening enthusiasm, while Pegeen
clung to Archibald’s shoulder and laughed
and cried and loved everybody harder than
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” she said to Mrs. Benderby
that night, after she had knelt beside her bed
for a long time. “I might exactly as well get
up. I’m so terribly happy I can’t think of a
single solitary thing to pray for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Meredith stayed at the house under
the maples on the night of the club house-warming;
and when he came down to breakfast
the next morning, he looked peculiarly
tired and worn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t sleep well, Dick,” his hostess
said reproachfully, as they went out to the
veranda after breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no; not as well as usual. Too much
festivity. The thing went off with a tremendous
bang, didn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded laughing assent; but he noticed
that she too showed signs of a wakeful night.
Her eyes were tired and there were faint, purplish
shadows beneath them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t Pegeen adorable?” she said. A
wave of tenderness swept from Meredith’s
mouth to his eyes and tarried there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s chronic with Pegeen.” His voice,
too, held tenderness. “I wonder what life
will do with that big tender heart of hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurt it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was seldom that the Smiling Lady was
pessimistic. Meredith looked at her quickly
and the tenderness in his face was not all for
Pegeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he agreed, “and she’ll love her way
straight through the hurt. I can’t believe that
even life can be unrelentingly hard to Pegeen.
Life isn’t often unrelentingly hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment or two, he stood silent, leaning
against a veranda pillar and twirling a
spray of belated honeysuckle bloom nervously
in his fingers. When he spoke again, his voice
was even quieter than usual, and there was
nothing more disturbing than grave friendliness
in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking, dear,” he said. “I’m
afraid life’s been a bit hard for <span class='it'>you</span>, lately.
All the love in the world won’t prevent mistakes;
and I guess we’ve made mistakes—you
and I—and your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl in the willow chair looked up at
him in swift question; but he went on without
allowing her to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, your father was my friend. He
believed in me and he couldn’t die easily,
leaving you all alone; so, because he knew I
loved you better than all the world, he planned
that I should stand between you and the world.
He meant it for your happiness—and I was
glad and proud—and you were willing—but
we were blind, all three of us. We did not
look along the road ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl made a little gesture of protest.
He dropped into a chair beside her, caught
the slender brown hands, and held them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at me, dear,” he begged. “Surely
you’re not afraid of me. You’re afraid
of hurting me. That’s it—and you can’t
save me from the hurt. I was afraid of
it right at first, after your father went away.
You were very young and I knew that youth
called to youth; but so many younger men
came and went away. It was easy to see you
didn’t care for any of them; and, in time, I
began to believe that I could make you happy.
I loved you as well as any man could and you
loved me—in a way—and trusted me, and
there was no one else. But even then I had
sense enough not to hurry you. So I waited—and
then the thing I had almost forgotten
to fear happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low, steady voice broke, and for a moment
fell into silence. Then he went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt, as soon as I came back here this
summer, that things were different; and after
a while I began to understand what the difference
was; but I waited to make sure. Last
night I knew. Tell me, Nora—We owe
each other frankness—Tell me—there <span class='it'>is</span>
some one else now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her eyes full of tears to meet his
that were full of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, and there was a sob in the
word. “I love you dearly; but—there is some
one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stooped his head and kissed the hands
he held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t cry, child. You mustn’t cry. You
should have told me long ago, instead of waiting
for my blundering brain to understand.
It’s all right. When I stood on the club house
stairs last night and looked at you and Archibald
among your neighbors—you so proud of
him and he so proud of you, and the neighbors
so proud of both of you—I realized how absolutely
right it was. It isn’t easy to give you
up—but it would be harder to have you and
not make you happy—and I’m not going to
drop out of your life. We’ve been friends
too long for that. Don’t worry over having
hurt me. I’m not going to be miserable.
I’ve rather a notion to try my hand at neighboring.
Peggy’s flatteringly sure I’d do well
at it, if I could get a good running start. Look
happy, dear. I think you are going to <span class='it'>be</span> very
happy—but there’s one thing I want from
Archibald and you. I want a share in
Pegeen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at him through her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy always told me you were the finest
gentleman in the world,” she said, “and I
think he was right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went away after that, leaving her to the
happiness she was too tender-hearted to show
him, and he said good-by cheerfully, unemotionally;
but he went down the road, with
white lips and unseeing eyes, and, when he
appeared at the door of the shack, Mrs. Benderby,
who was sitting there, rose in alarm at
the sight of his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Archibald’s away for a walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meredith made no sign that he had heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegeen,” he said unsteadily. “I want
Pegeen.”</p>

<h1 id='t8318'>XV</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald’s walk had taken him
Witch Hill way. Golden rod and wild
asters were making merry along the roadside;
and, in the wood’s heart, gleams of crimson
and gold were glinting through the green.
Summer was gone; but magic lingered; and
the old enchantment worked in the man’s
brain and heart. He had never followed
that climbing road without the Smiling Lady
at his side and his heart was sick for her, for
the eyes with the sea waves in them, for the
sun-kissed hair, and the smiling lips, and the
singing voice, and all the warm gladness of
her. He had known it would be like that;
and yet he had come. There were days when
wisdom did not wear the look of a virtue; and
this afternoon, when Pegeen was busy with
housework and even Wiggles had wandered
away on important business of his own, the
man who had been trying to be contented gave
up trying and set out to keep tryst with memory,
beside a hilltop well, where on a summer
day a witch had sat, smiling and weaving
spells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in no hurry. There were mile-stones
to count along the way. Here she had
leaned to look into the brook; there she had
stooped to mock a bird’s call. All the little
green leaves whispered of her and the red and
gold leaves flamed more warmly, remembering
her. Archibald wondered whether he was
sorry he had come—or glad. Glad, he
thought; but it was a sorry gladness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he neared the top of the hill, he paused,
half inclined to go back, without facing the
empty seat under the old oak tree; but running
away was a habit he had put aside. With a
queer smile that was not gay, he quickened his
steps, pushed aside the branches that had
grown across the path, and came out into the
open. There was the well. There was the
great tree. And there, on the mossy bank, in
the shadow, sat the witch, smiling and weaving
spells!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet, at sight of him. The
smiles fled; but the spells worked on. The
two looked into each other’s eyes, questioning,
avowing. Without telling, other than the
glad surrender in her face, the man knew that
the world was changed for them, that the
walls were down. All wonder, and great desire,
he opened his arms; and, there in the enchanted
wood, where “anything might happen,”
they met “the Wonderful Thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen was alone in her garden, when Archibald
and the Smiling Lady went to her. As
she saw them coming, the soberness that had
hung about her since Richard Meredith had
left her a half hour earlier melted away, and
she ran to meet them with a joyful little cry.
It was hard that the two she loved best must
have their happiness at the cost of some one
else; but, after all, it was glorious that they
<span class='it'>were</span> happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been talking about you, Peg,”
Archibald said, when they three and Wiggles
were comfortably seated on the doorstep—which
was quite wide enough for four, if
nobody minded crowding—and nobody did—“How
would you like to go to boarding
school this fall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peg’s face clouded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t be far away, dear,” the Smiling
Lady interposed hastily, “and we’ll be
living in town after Thanksgiving; so you
could spend all your Sundays and holidays
with us; and then we’d all be up here together
next summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfully sweet of you,” Peg was
polite but unconvinced. “I’m ever so much
obliged; but I guess I’ll stay right here and
see to Mrs. Benderby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll fix Mrs. Benderby up all right,”
Archibald promised. “She can board with
the Neals. They want a boarder and I’ll give
her an allowance that will make her comfortable.
Then she won’t have to work except
when she feels just like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pegeen abandoned Mrs. Benderby to a life
of idle luxury, but still thought she would
stay in the Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t need me.” Her voice was wistful
as she made the admission. “Miss Moran
will see to you—and I’m not jealous, not
really, you know, only I’m sort of lonesomey.
There’s sure to be somebody here in the Valley
that’ll need me and I feel as if I’ve just
got to have somebody to see to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll always need you, Peg—always.”
Archibald’s arm went round her and drew her
close. “Even Miss Moran can’t see to me so
that I won’t need you. And there are plenty
of people here in the Valley who’d be the better
for having you with them; but there’s
something you haven’t realized yet, dear.
The whole world needs seeing to; and there
aren’t many people like you who have a genius
for doing it. You mustn’t be wasted on
two or three neighbors, here in the Valley,
when outside, beyond the hills, there are thousands
and thousands needing what you could
give them. Don’t you see, Peg? You’ve
got to reach those poor unhappy thousands
and help them. Other women are doing it—doing
it wonderfully. Out in Chicago there’s
a woman who must have been a girl with a
heart like yours; and now she’s seeing to a
whole city and to men and women and children
out beyond that city, all over the world.
She’s only one of the many; and there’s nothing
they are doing that you can’t do, if you’ll
work your way to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Nora and I want to help you
to; and school’s the first step toward it.
What do you say, Pegeen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child’s face was rapt, illumined. The
great blue eyes were seeing visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my stars!” she murmured longingly.
“If I could—if I only could! Wouldn’t it
be wonderful?—better than Jizo. Of course
I’ll go to school, I’d love to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flash of recollection swept across the future-searching
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve got to have time enough in between
to see to Mr. Meredith,” she stipulated.
“He needs me.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='ul'>THE LIGHT OF WESTERN STARS</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Colored frontispiece by W. Herbert Dunton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the action of this story takes place near the turbulent
Mexican border of the present day. A New York society girl buys
a ranch which becomes the center of frontier warfare. Her loyal
cowboys defend her property from bandits, and her superintendent
rescues her when she is captured by them. A surprising climax
brings the story to a delightful close.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='ul'>DESERT GOLD</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Illustrated by Douglas Duer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another fascinating story of the Mexican border. Two men,
lost in the desert, discover gold when, overcome by weakness, they
can go no farther. The rest of the story describes the recent uprising
along the border, and ends with the finding of the gold which the
two prospectors had willed to the girl who is the story’s heroine.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='ul'>RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Illustrated by Douglas Duer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A picturesque romance of Utah of some forty years ago when
Mormon authority ruled. In the persecution of Jane Withersteen, a
rich ranch owner, we are permitted to see the methods employed by
the invisible hand of the Mormon Church to break her will.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='ul'>THE LAST OF THE PLAINSMEN</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Illustrated with photograph reproductions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the record of a trip which the author took with Buffalo
Jones, known as the preserver of the American bison, across the
Arizona desert and of a hunt in “that wonderful country of yellow
crags, deep canons and giant pines.” It is a fascinating story.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='ul'>THE HERITAGE OF THE DESERT</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Jacket in color. Frontispiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This big human drama is played in the Painted Desert. A
lovely girl, who has been reared among Mormons, learns to love a
young New Englander. The Mormon religion, however, demands
that the girl shall become the second wife of one of the Mormons—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, that’s the problem of this sensational, big selling story.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='ul'>BETTY ZANE</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Illustrated by Louis F. Grant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This story tells of the bravery and heroism of Betty, the beautiful
young sister of old Colonel Zane, one of the bravest pioneers.
Life along the frontier, attacks by Indians, Betty’s heroic defense
of the beleaguered garrison at Wheeling, the burning of the Fort,
and Betty’s final race for life, make up this never-to-be-forgotten story.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
